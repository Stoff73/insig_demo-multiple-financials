Our efforts in recent years have been focused on ar strengthening our land bank, improving our planning approach, increasing use of our un and investment in sales - all while maintaining a strong balance sheet and our commerc strong and sustainable platform for the future.

In the first six months of the year, this enabled us to grow our outlet base to 277 sales o 2024),  deliver  a  7%  increase  in  private  completions  (4%  growth  in  total  completions) operating profit 1 by 13%.

Our marketing campaigns are generating increased traffic to sites and online, and we hav to  address  affordability  challenges  including  taking  reservations  through  our  "New  B addition, our relaunched Charles Church offering is performing well and we have a strong Overall, the net private sales rate per outlet per week excluding bulk was up 5% to 0.62 0.59).

Our sustained improvement in customer service continues, with our 5-star homebuilder sta consecutive  year  and  both  Charles  Church  and  Persimmon  Homes  operating  at  'Exce Trustpilot.

We have also continued to invest in innovation and vertical integration in the first half of automated production line at our existing Space4 factory now operational and further enh the second half of the year. A live trial of the Mauer facade with our Space4 timber frame is this month for one of our Build to Rent ('BTR') partners.

We are well placed to capture further opportunities. Persimmon benefits from a strong bala and growing pipeline of outlets, complemented by the strength of our longer-term strategic while we are mindful of macroeconomic volatility, we have made good progress in the first positioned  for  further  growth.  We  remain  on  track  to  deliver  11,000-11,500  completions housing  operating  margin  of  14.2%-14.5%,  in  line  with  previous  guidance. As  outlined remains to achieve a 20% housing operating margin and 20% ROCE over the medium-term

## Trading performance

We  delivered  4,605  completions  in  the  first  half  of  the  year,  a  4%  increase  on  the (2024:  4,445)  driven  by  strong  growth  in  private  completions,  up  7%.  The  Group's  a completions rose 8% to £284,047 (2024: £263,288) driven by a greater proportion of pri and robust private average sales prices in the period.

This performance is particularly pleasing given the challenging market environment that we have been some positive developments in the first half of the year, with targeted relaxatio and real term pay rises helping to improve affordability for some. Nonetheless, this has impact of council tax, national insurance, stamp duty and energy bill increases in April, alo uncertainty weighing on consumer sentiment. While interest and mortgage rates have red that  still  present  a  barrier  to  many  potential  customers.  Our  homes  are  well  placed  in significantly below our largest competitors, and we have sought to make them more access by improving the range of affordable routes to homeownership.

Throughout the first half, our marketing campaigns continued to generate healthy traffic t website visitors up c.20% and enquiries up c.13% in the period. To meet the diverse need offer a wide range of incentives, including our innovative 'Flexi Boost' concept and the r Build Boost product in partnership with Generation Home. This shared equity product is su affordability constraints, reflecting our on-going commitment to innovative, customer-focuse

Our efforts translated into a 5% increase in the net private sales rate per outlet excluding half (2024: 0.59). Including bulk sales, the total net private sales rate was 0.70 per outlet p the period, equivalent to 191 sales per week up 3% compared to H1 2024 (186 per week prices on reservations taken in the six-month period were up 5% with incentives contro reservations (2024: c.4.5%). Pricing dynamics remain more favourable in the North and Sc challenges persisting particularly in the South where price growth has been more modest.

Given  the  challenging  market  backdrop  and  continued  but  diminishing  embedded  co delighted  to  have  achieved  13%  growth  in  underlying  operating  profit 1 in  the  period,  su integration and operational efficiencies. These unique capabilities have helped underpin o help drive further growth. We continue to anticipate that build cost inflation will be in the low as we have been able to leverage our position as a growing business in a subdued marke commercial terms.

## High quality land bank and growing outlets

Our progress in the land market continues to highlight the strength of our disciplined inves spend of £210m during the period, up from £195m in the same period last year. We h 5,729  new  plots  to  our  owned  and  under  control  land  holdings,  achieving  a  replacem maintaining  excellent  embedded  margins  within  our  land  bank.  Combined  with  our  succ providing us with the platform for further growth into the medium term.

While we are yet to see material benefits from the government's planning reform, we rema will start to benefit planning approvals in time. We have continued to focus on actions we ca and continue to  find  innovative  solutions  to  planning  blockages. A  recent  instance  is  at Suffolk,  where  a  2.3  hectare  habitat  will  be  developed  to  support  the  local  stone  curlew priority species, facilitating planning approval for 139 zero-carbon ready homes.

In total, we secured detailed or reserved matters planning for 5,066 plots in the period, inc originated from our strategic land holdings. Over the last rolling 12 months we have achie or reserved matters planning approvals than in the previous 12 months, ahead of industry see further opportunities for near-term conversion from our strategic land bank and have

During the period we also achieved outline planning approval on our 1,000+ homes stra Park in Cheltenham, which we purchased in October last year. This is an excellent site f rates on our neighbouring site and the potential for all three brands to be used to deliver homes.

Our  sustained,  disciplined  investment  in  land  coupled  with  our  planning  approvals  suc business for future growth. We opened 55 new outlets (2024: 44 outlets) and ended the pe 4% increase from the previous year (2024: 266 outlets), as the wider sector has reduced strong pipeline and plans to open around 45 more outlets in the second half of 2025, we our goal of at least 300 outlets, positioning us for continued success and growth.

## Three strong brands providing diversification

We  have  three  strong  brands  across  the  business  in  Persimmon  Homes,  Charles Partnerships, each serving a different segment of the market and providing a diversified p our homes to.

Our core Persimmon brand remains attractive to a wide range of customers. Our disciplin consistently  offer  homes  at  prices  significantly  below  our  largest  competitors,  with  a accessible homeownership. This positions us as a compelling alternative to second-hand given our smaller, more efficient house types and innovative purchasing options. By levera integration and careful material choices, we have supported margins while delivering valu broad range of customers. These foundations underpin the continued appeal of our develo Private completions under the Persimmon brand were up 5% in the period benefiting from o initiatives and the success of our growing network of outlets.

Charles Church, our premium offering, has gained significant momentum, especially follow at Harlestone Grange in March. In the first half of this year, Charles Church private complet Recognising the brand's appeal, we are actively pursuing opportunities for both standalone and expanding into new regions. As of 30 June, we had 53 Charles Church sites, 35 of wh Our ambition remains to double the number of completions delivered under our higher brand over the medium-term.

The  reputation  we  have  built  by  consistently  improving  our  product  range,  build  quality continues  to  open  doors  to  new  partnerships  and  opportunities  including  through our completions to housing associations were, as anticipated, lower in the first half of the yea 703), this largely reflects timing, with delivery of homes in this segment accelerated in pre full year housing association completions to be ahead of 2024 and are fully secured.

The government's recent affordable housing funding announcements provide some long market. The Spending Review's allocation of £39bn to the Affordable Homes Programme ( of  a  CPI+1% rent settlement, both over 10 years, have been welcomed by the sector. W benefit  when more detail becomes available. The precise funding available for the next 2026 is still yet to be announced, including how it will support the government's commitm

homes funded through the programme to be Social Rent. With significant financial press Registered  Providers,  it  will  be  important  to  closely  monitor  how  the  rent  settlem announcements improve their appetite for s106 properties in the coming years.

The institutional investor and BTR markets present a good opportunity for long-term, capita delivered 590 homes in the first half for our partners (2024: 524). Savills research recently up 8% of all new build sales in England and Wales last year. Our improved reputation in t us  to  expand  our  collaborations  to  include  14  new  partners  this  year.  These  strategic diversify our revenue streams but also accelerate delivery and enhance our capital returns.

Through the combination of these three strong brands, customer segments, and market ch robust, adaptable business to support our medium-term growth.

## Build quality and customer service

The investment into our sales and marketing teams is showing tangible benefits, with m improving 7% compared with the second half of 2024. Since December 2022, customer c 26% with trust in the Persimmon brand up 17%.

We also saw further improvements on build quality during the period with our Construction up 4% and Reportable Items 3 maintained at 0.23 (2024: 0.23).

## Innovation &amp; vertical integration

Our  vertical  integration  capabilities  have  been  a  core  strength  that  we  are  enhancin expanded  off-site  manufacture  will  be  essential  in  delivering  our  growth  ambitions.  We existing factories to expand the use of their cost-effective products across the business an further, securing and sustaining cost advantages in the coming years. We are complement a  digitalised  operational  system  that  provides  greater  control  of  build  programme, management.

The investment in Brickworks, Tileworks and Space4 has enhanced the range and qual high-quality  materials  they  supply  to  the  business.  The  typical  per  plot  cost  saving  if  ou timber  frame  products  are  used  is  up  to  £5,500.  By  investing  in  these  products,  we  are supply and improving build and cost efficiency.

Our new generation brick has proved popular, including amongst a growing number of loca shift now added at the Brickworks factory to meet the increased demand.

In  the  first  half  of  the  year,  we  installed  a  new  state-of-the-art  automated  timber  frame Space4 factory. We believe this is the most advanced timber frame line in the country, enh efficiency and the consistency of frame quality. An automated roof truss line will open later range of products Space4 offers.

This  investment  reflects  the  significant  growth  in  demand  for  the  product.  In  the  first  h provided  1,703  timber  frame  products  as  well  as  457  roof  cassettes.

We will shortly start an on-site trial combining our timber frame with the Mauer brick facad BTR customers. The combination of timber frames produced in our new factory and the Ma opportunity  for  a  significant  step-up  in  housing  output,  while  securing  additional  saving manufacturing costs and even faster build times.

Another area of innovation has been significant investment in new digital operational ma are already strengthening operational controls and driving new cost efficiencies, with new sought. On-site digitalisation of material management, quality assurance and the real time labour  levels  is  providing  a  granular  level  of  control  that  benefits  cost  efficiency  and Management  teams  now  have  real  time  tracking  of  trade  activity  on  site  to  assure  the necessary labour to deliver their programme. This data also allows us to plan future build p evidence, enhancing build efficiency and providing delivery assurance.

These enhanced on-site digital tools are also allowing greater cost controls, such as wit enhancing  the  monitoring  of  costs,  it  is  enabling  our  new  Chief  Commercial  Officer  to spending  across  the  Group  and  identify  best  practice  and  cost  savings  opportunities.

Persimmon's long-term strategy, which recognises the housing  cycle  by  maintaining  operational  flexibility,  investing  in  high  quality  land,  min deploying  capital  at  the  right  time  in  the  cycle,  has  equipped  the  business  with  stro balance sheet.

The Group delivered 4,605 new homes (2024: 4,445) and generated profit before tax of in the period. At 30 June 2025, the Group had a strong balance sheet with £123.0m of ca quality  land  holdings  and  land  creditors  of  £401.1m  (December  2024:  £423.2m).  The Credit Facility of £700m which was extended by a further year during the period out to was undrawn at 30 June 2025.

The Directors have reviewed the Group's principal risks, see note 17 of this announcem there are no new principal risks facing the business to those disclosed in the financia ended  31  December  2024.  The  Directors  considered  the  impact  of  these  risks  on  t business when approving these full year financial statements for the Group.

The Directors have considered the going concern assessment for the period to 31 Dece severe  but  plausible  scenarios  based  on  reduced  new  home  sales  materialising effectiveness of mitigating actions that would be executed by the Directors. In each scen operate within its facilities.

The Directors have also considered a 'Reverse Stress Test' to demonstrate the point at wh liquid funds or breaches covenants but note the likelihood of this is less than remote.

In addition, the Group has been increasingly assessing climate related risks and opportu the  Group.  During  the  period  assessed  for  going  concern  no  significant  risk  has  be materially impact the Group's ability to generate sufficient cash and continue as a going co

Having considered the inherent strength of the UK housing market, the resilience of th prices and the Group's scenario analysis, the Directors have a reasonable expectation tha resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, th going concern basis in preparing these condensed consolidated half year financial stateme

The fair value is determined by reference could be exchanged by knowledgeable and willing parties. Fair value is determined by flows for the residual period of the contract by a risk adjusted rate.

There exists an element of uncertainty over the precise final valuation and timing of cas assets. As a result, the Group has applied inputs based on current market conditions experience of actual cash flows resulting from such arrangements. These inputs are by such, the fair value has been classified as level 3 under the fair value hierarchy laid o Measurement.

Significant  unobservable  inputs  into  the  fair  value  measurement  calculation  inclu movements  based  on  the  Group's  actual  experience  of  regional  house  pricing  and  m future movements, weighted average duration of the loans from inception to settlemen years)  and  a  discount  rate  of  8.8%  (2024:  8.8%)  based  on  current  observed  market private individuals on secured second loans.

The discounted forecast cash flow calculation is dependent upon the estimated future v which the shared equity loans are secured. Adjustments to this input, which might res wider property market, would have a proportional impact upon the fair value of the asse easily accessible in advance, the resulting change in security value may affect the cred counterparty, influencing fair value further.
