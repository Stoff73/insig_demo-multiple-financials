The fair value is determined by reference could be exchanged by knowledgeable and willing parties. Fair value is determined by flows for the residual period of the contract by a risk adjusted rate.

There exists an element of uncertainty over the precise final valuation and timing of cas assets. As a result, the Group has applied inputs based on current market conditions experience of actual cash flows resulting from such arrangements. These inputs are by such, the fair value has been classified as level 3 under the fair value hierarchy laid o Measurement.

Significant  unobservable  inputs  into  the  fair  value  measurement  calculation  inclu movements  based  on  the  Group's  actual  experience  of  regional  house  pricing  and  m future movements, weighted average duration of the loans from inception to settlemen years)  and  a  discount  rate  of  8.8%  (2024:  8.8%)  based  on  current  observed  market private individuals on secured second loans.

The discounted forecast cash flow calculation is dependent upon the estimated future v which the shared equity loans are secured. Adjustments to this input, which might res wider property market, would have a proportional impact upon the fair value of the asse easily accessible in advance, the resulting change in security value may affect the cred counterparty, influencing fair value further.
