4.  Exceptional items of $807m for the year ended 31 March 2024 relate to derivative and foreign exchange losses following the devaluation of the Nigerian naira ($770m) in June 2023 and three month period ended 31 March 2024 as well as the Malawian kwacha devaluation in November 2023 ($37m), respectively.

6.  Tax exceptional items of $258m for the year ended 31 March 2024 reflects gain corresponding to exceptional items of $807m on account of derivative and foreign exchange losses (refer point 4). $161m exceptional tax gain in the prior period reflects the recognition of deferred tax credit in Kenya, the DRC and Tanzania.

## A resilient business able to seize growth opportunities while managing foreign exchange and macroeconomic volatility

We continue to see sustained operating momentum, demonstrating the resilience of our business model and the effective execution of our strategy across all our regions. Mobile money continues to see very strong trends with constant currency revenue growth of 32.8% reflecting continued customer growth and enhancements in the available products and services across the platform.

Group revenue in constant currency grew by 20.9%, supporting a 21.3% growth in constant currency EBITDA, despite inflationary pressures from rising fuel prices across a number of markets. However, currency devaluation had a significant impact on our reported currency financial performance, with revenues and EBITDA declining 5.3% and 5.7% respectively. The most significant devaluation was in Nigeria, our largest market, where the naira devalued from NGN461 per US dollar on 31 March 2023 to NGN1,303 per US dollar on 31 March 2024. EBITDA margins have been negatively impacted by approximately 70bps because of the reduced Nigerian contribution to Group revenue and EBITDA following the devaluation.

Despite this backdrop, we were able to continue upstreaming cash from various OpCos, including Nigeria, where the year saw challenges in the availability of US dollars. This upstreaming has resulted in a net cash position at HoldCo, and we are fully geared to repay the US dollar bond falling due in May 2024. Our strategy to reduce US dollar debt has also remained on track, with over 83% of OpCo market debt being based in local currency.

This balance sheet strength gives us the flexibility to continue executing on the opportunities our markets offer, enabling us to deliver on our ambitions to bridge the digital divide and drive higher financial inclusion.

## Our four main financial objectives broadly remained the same:

## 1. Growing our operating profitability

We have delivered high double-digit revenue and EBITDA growth in constant currency. Despite significant inflationary cost pressures, particularly fuel price rises in Nigeria and a few other key markets, we have been able to deliver EBITDA margin resilience by focusing on operating efficiencies. In particular, we have seen significant progress in our mobile money segment which saw EBITDA margins rise to 52.1% during the period. Operating profit during the year grew by 20.3% in constant currency, similar to the levels reported in the prior period.

## 2.  Investment for future growth and stable return on capital employed

Around 87% of our capex investment in 2023/24 was directed towards growth initiatives which are targeted to enhance network capacity, increase coverage and ensure reliable connectivity. We invested $737m in capex (excluding licence renewal and spectrum acquisition), to improve network capacity and quality, and to reinforce a future-ready network, through IT and cybersecurity to further protect our business from the global threat of cyberattacks, focusing on the areas of application, network, and API security. We also invested $152m in licence renewal and spectrum acquisition costs, including $127m for 3G licence renewal in Nigeria.

We monitor the effectiveness of our capex investment through our financial KPI 'return on capital employed'. Regular monitoring of this KPI helps us track the performance of our assets while also taking long-term financing into consideration. Our return on capital employed remained largely stable around 23% despite foreign exchange headwinds.

## 3.  Strengthening balance sheet through localisation of OpCo debt

We continued to localise our OpCo debt, with over 83% of the market debt now in local currency as of 31 March 2024. We have around $680m of cash at HoldCo following strong cash flow generation and upstreaming from key markets. Given this strong cash position, we are fully geared up to repay the HoldCo debt of $550m which is due for repayment in May 2024.

Key benefits of localising debt at the OpCo level are protection against foreign exchange headwinds and mitigation against the unavailability of foreign currency in the country.

Leverage was 1.4x at the end of the period, same as in the previous period despite continued investments in our network and significant currency devaluation in Nigeria which resulted in lower reported currency EBITDA.

## 4. Returns to shareholders

Returning cash to shareholders through our progressive dividend policy remains a key priority. In line with our dividend policy, we paid an interim dividend of 2.38 cents per share in December 2023. Further, the Board recommended a final dividend of 3.57 cents per share, making total dividend of 5.95 cents per share, which is an increase of 9% compared to the prior year. Additionally, the Board approved a share buy-back programme of up to $100m, which will take place over a period of up to 12 months. On 1 March 2024, we announced the commencement of the first tranche of the buy-back up to a maximum of $50m. During March 2024, the company purchased 7.4 million shares at a total cost of $9m.

Basic EPS at negative 4.4 cents was impacted by the derivative and foreign exchange losses in key markets, most significantly in Nigeria and Malawi. EPS before exceptional items was at 10.1 cents, declined 25.9% compared to 13.6 cents in the prior period also impacted by derivative and foreign exchange losses.

## Outlook

The growth opportunity that exists across our markets remains compelling, and we're well positioned to deliver against this opportunity. We will continue to focus on margin improvement from the recent levels as we progress through the year. We will continue to work on mitigation plans to limit the negative impact of these headwinds, with a particular focus on seeing sustained high revenue growth as well as driving operating efficiencies. Furthermore, we will continue to focus on strengthening our balance sheet through localisation of OpCo debt and increased returns to shareholders.

During the reporting period, the currencies in a few of the markets significantly devalued at various stages throughout the year, hence, the impact of devaluation on reported currency revenue and EBITDA has not been fully reflected in the results for the period ended 31 March 2024. Consequently, the full impact of last year's currency devaluation will be seen in next financial years' reported revenue and EBITDA. Furthermore, the full impact on EBITDA margin due to the reduction in Nigeria contribution to revenue and EBITDA, is approximately 120bps, out of which 70bps have been factored in to the current financial year and the remaining balance of 50bps is expected in t he next financial year.

Our capex outlook (excluding license renewal and spectrum acquisition) for next year is around $725m to $750m, which includes additional investment in our data centre and fibre businesses.
