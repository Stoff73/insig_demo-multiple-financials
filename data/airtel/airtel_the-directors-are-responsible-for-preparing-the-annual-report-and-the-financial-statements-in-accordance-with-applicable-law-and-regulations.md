## The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law, the directors are required to prepare our financial statements in accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards in line with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. We have elected to prepare the company's financial statements in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (GAAP), including FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework. Under company law, the directors must not approve the accounts unless satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of our company and of our profit or loss for that period.

In preparing our company's financial statements, the directors are required to:

-  Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently
-  Make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent
-  State whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements
-  Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that Airtel Africa will continue in business

In preparing the Group financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that directors:

-  Properly select and apply accounting policies
-  Present information, including accounting policies, in a way that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information
-  Provide additional disclosures when the specific requirements in IFRSs do not enable readers to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on our financial position and financial performance
-  Assess our ability to continue as a going concern

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that show and explain the company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time our financial position. These records must also enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. Directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and for taking reasonable steps to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.

The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on our website. UK legislation governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

## Controls over financial reporting

Our Executive Committee and the Board are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, emerging risks and principal risks for the Group.

Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that:

-  Relate to the maintenance of records that accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets in reasonable detail
-  Are designed to provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and approved for use in the United Kingdom (UK) by the UK Accounting Standards Endorsement Board (UKEB)

## Responsibility statement

## We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:

-  The financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole.
-  The strategic report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
-  The Annual Report and financial statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information necessary for shareholders to assess the company's position and performance, business model and strategy.

This responsibility statement was approved by the Board of directors on 8 May 2024 and is signed on its behalf by:

-  Provide reasonable assurance around prevention and timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could materially affect the financial statements.

Any internal control framework, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls and procedures - and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of future effectiveness are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or because of reduced compliance with the policies or procedures.

Through the outcome of a self-review programme, the Group assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on 31 March 2024. Our controls were also subjected to other assurance activities: Group Internal Audit tested key controls on a regular basis and reported their findings, and Group External Audit also tested controls as part of their statutory audit process. No significant or material control weaknesses were identified.

The Group regularly discusses anticipated new regulatory requirements in relation to internal controls over financial reporting. Regulatory developments will continue to be monitored and the Group will adopt requirements as the landscape develops to ensure full compliance.

During the period covered by this document, there were no changes in the Group's internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.
