## Our responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on whether the iXBRL mark up of consolidated financial statements complies in all material respects with DTR 4.1.15R-DTR 4.1.18R based on the evidence we have obtained. We conducted our reasonable assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements (UK) 3000, Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information ('ISAE (UK) 3000') issued by the FRC.

A reasonable assurance engagement in accordance with ISAE (UK) 3000 involves performing procedures to obtain reasonable assurance about the compliance of the mark up of the consolidated financial statements with the DTR 4.1.15R-DTR 4.1.18R. The nature, timing and extent of procedures selected depend on the practitioner's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material departures from the requirements set out in DTR 4.1.15R-DTR 4.1.18R, whether due to fraud or error. Our reasonable assurance engagement consisted primarily of:

-  obtaining an understanding of the iXBRL mark up process, including internal control over the mark up process relevant to the engagement;
-  reconciling the marked up data with the audited consolidated financial statements of the company dated 8 May 2024;
-  evaluating the appropriateness of the company's mark up of the consolidated financial statements using the iXBRL mark-up language;
-  evaluating the appropriateness of the company's use of iXBRL elements selected from a generally accepted taxonomy and the creation of extension elements where no suitable element in the generally accepted taxonomy has been identified; and
-  evaluating the use of anchoring in relation to the extension elements.

In this report we do not express an audit opinion, review conclusion or any other assurance conclusion on the consolidated financial statements. Our audit opinion relating to the consolidated financial statements of the company for the year ended 31 March 2024 is set out in our Independent Auditor's Report dated 8 May 2024.

## Use of our report

Our report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with ISAE (UK) 3000. Our work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company those matters we are required to state to them in this report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company's members as a body for our work, this report, or for the conclusions we have formed.
