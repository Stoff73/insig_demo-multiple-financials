## Directors' report continued

## Important events since the end of the financial year

Details of important events affecting the Group that have occurred since the end of the financial year are set out in the strategic report and note 34 to the consolidated financial statements on page 238.

## Our auditor

Deloitte LLP has confirmed its willingness to continue as our auditor. Following our Audit and Risk Committee's review of its effectiveness (described on page 136), we will propose at our AGM that we reappoint Deloitte LLP.

Our policy is that our auditor will not carry out non-audit services, except where appropriate and in line with our policy for doing such work. Our Audit and Risk Committee also considers the ethical and auditing professional standards related to non-audit services by our external auditor. Deloitte LLP provided limited non-audit services during the year in line with our policy as described in the Audit and Risk Committee report - see page 136.

As at the date of this report, so far as each director is aware, there's no relevant audit information of which our auditor is unaware. Each director confirms that they've taken all appropriate steps to make themselves aware of relevant audit information and to make sure our auditor is aware of that information. This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.

## Audit and Risk Committee recommendations and statements of compliance

The committee has completed its review of the effectiveness of internal controls, including risk management, during the year and up to the date of this Annual Report. The review covered all material controls including financial, operating and compliance. As such, we can provide assurance to the Board under the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code. This is covered in more detail in the Audit and Risk Committee report - see pages 126-137.

Airtel Africa has complied throughout the reporting period with the provisions of the Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) order 2014.

## Annual General Meeting

Our AGM will be live streamed on Wednesday 3 July 2024 at 11am BST from 53/54 Grosvenor Street, London W1K 3HU. Details of the business to be transacted at the AGM are included in our 2024 Notice of the Annual General Meeting available on our website at www.airtel.africa.

In line with recent practice and good governance, we'll conduct all voting on resolutions at this year's AGM by poll. The Board believes that this way of voting gives as many shareholders as possible the opportunity to have their votes counted.

This directors' report has been approved by the Board and is signed on its behalf by:
