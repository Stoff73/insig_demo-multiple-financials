## Notes to company only financial statements

(All	amounts	are	in	US$	millions	unless	stated	otherwise)

## 1. Summary of significant accounting policies

## Basis of preparation

The	company	only	financial	statements	are	presented	as	required	by the	Companies	Act	2006.	The	company	meets	the	definition	of	a qualifying	entity	under	FRS	100	'Application	of	Financial	Reporting Requirements'	issued	by	the	FRC.	Accordingly,	the	company	has prepared	financial	statements	as	per	FRS	101	'Reduced	Disclosure Framework.

Airtel	Africa	plc	is	the	parent	of	the	smallest	group	for	which consolidated	financial	statements	are	prepared	and	of	which	the company	is	a	member.	The	largest	group	to	consolidate	the	results of	the	company	is	Bharti	Airtel	Limited,	which	is	registered	in	India. The	Bharti	Airtel	Limited	Group	financial	statements	are	publically available	and	can	be	obtained	at	www.airtel.in.

All	the	amounts	included	in	the	company	only	financial	statements are	reported	in	United	States	dollars	(the	functional	currency	of	the company),	with	all	values	rounded	to	the	nearest	millions	(USD millions)	except	when	otherwise	indicated.	Further,	amounts	which are	less	than	half	a	million	are	appearing	as	'0'.

As	permitted	by	Section	408(3)	of	the	Companies	Act	2006,	no	profit and	loss	account	of	the	company	is	presented.

As	permitted	by	FRS	101,	the	company	has	taken	advantage	of	the disclosure	exemptions	available	in	relation	to:

-  The	requirements	of	IFRS	7	Financial	Instruments:	Disclosures
-  The	requirements	of	IAS	7	Statement	of	Cash	Flows
-  The	statement	of	compliance	with	Adopted	IFRSs
-  The	effects	of	new	but	not	yet	effective	IFRSs
-  The	requirements	in	IAS	24	'Related	party	disclosure'	to	disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more members	of	a	Group.
-  Disclosures in respect of capital management; and
-  Paragraphs	45(b)	and	46	to	52	of	IFRS	2,	'Shared-based	payment' (details	of	the	number	and	weighted-average	exercise	prices	of share	options).

Where required, equivalent disclosures are given in the consolidated financial	statements.	The	company	financial	statements	have	been prepared	on	a	going	concern	and	historical	cost	basis.	The	principal accounting policies adopted are the same as those set out in note 2 of the	consolidated	financial	statements	except	the	following	additional policies	which	are	relevant	to	the	company	only	financial	statements:

-  Investment	in	subsidiary	undertakings	are	accounted	for	at	cost.
-  Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders' rights to receive payment have been established (provided	that	it	is	probable	that	the	economic	benefits	will	flow	to the	company	and	the	amount	of	revenue	can	be	measured	reliably).

## 2. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty

In the application of the company's accounting policies, which are described in note 1, the directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and	liabilities	that	are	not	readily	apparent	from	other	sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience	and	other	factors	that	are	considered	to	be	relevant. Actual	results	may	differ	from	these	estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing	basis.	Revisions	to	accounting	estimates	are	recognised	in the	period	in	which	the	estimate	is	revised	if	the	revision	affects	only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision	affects	both	current	and	future	periods.	There	were	no	critical accounting	judgments	and	estimates	that	would	have	a	significant effect	on	the	amount	recognised	in	the	company	financial	statements.

The	average	monthly	number	of	employees	during	the	year	was	two	(March	2023:	six).
