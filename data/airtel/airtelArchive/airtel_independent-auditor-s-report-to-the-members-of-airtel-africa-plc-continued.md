Based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the Corporate Governance Statement is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit:

-  the directors' statement with regards to the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting and any material uncertainties identified set out on page 131 and 178;
-  the directors' explanation as to its assessment of the group's prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate set out on page 80-81;
-  the directors' statement on fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 132;
-  the board's confirmation that it has carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks set out on page 72;
-  the section of the annual report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems set out on page 73-79; and
-  the section describing the work of the Audit and Risk Committee set out on pages 126-137.

## 14. Matters on which we are required to report byÂ exception

We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of directors' remuneration have not been made or the part of the directors' remuneration report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
