## 2. Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report.

We are independent of the group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the Financial Reporting Council's (the 'FRC's') Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. The non-audit services provided to the group and the parent company for the year are disclosed in note 8.1 to the financial statements. We confirm that we have not provided any non-audit services prohibited by the FRC's Ethical Standard to the group or the parent company.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

## 3. Summary of our audit approach

## Key audit matters

The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:

-  Prepaid and mobile money revenue;
-  Mobile money restricted cash;
-  Classification of legal matters; and
-  Devaluation of the Nigerian naira.

Within this report, key audit matters are identified as follows:

-  Newly identified
-  Increased level of risk
- Similar level of risk
-  Decreased level of risk

The materiality that we used for the group financial statements was $65m, determined using a range of metrics. Materiality represents 1.3% of revenue, 2.7% of EBITDA, 2.8% of net assets, 8.7% of underlying profit before tax and 0.7% of total assets.

In the current year the GSM (also known as mobile services) and Airtel Money (also known as mobile money) businesses in each country were classified as separate components to reflect the continued growth in the Airtel Money business. There were four full-scope audits, ten were subject to an audit of specified account balances and all other businesses were subject to review at group level. The full scope and specified account balances covered 91% of group EBITDA, 85% of group revenue and 88% of group net assets.

During the year, the Nigerian naira ('NGN') devalued significantly against the USD. This devaluation has had a significant impact on the financial performance of the group and the financial statements as a whole. We therefore identified the impact that the devaluation of NGN had on the financial statements as a key audit matter for the current year.

Significant changes in our approach

We also identified the GSM business in the Democratic Republic of the Congo as a full scope audit this year to reflect an increase in the size of that business. Key changes in component scope are summarised above.

## 4. Conclusions relating to going concern

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Our evaluation of the directors' assessment of the group's and parent company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:

-  obtaining an understanding of the relevant controls over the group's forecasting process;
-  performing retrospective reviews of the historical forecasts to assess the reasonableness of the group's forecasting process;
-  performing risk assessment procedures in response to continued macro-economic uncertainty in many African markets including but not limited to currency devaluation and higher inflation. In particular we updated our risk assessment procedures to consider whether the devaluation of NGN increases the going concern risk, including the impact on the group's liquidity position if the group is unable to repatriate US dollars from Nigeria;
-  assessing the reasonableness of the anticipated impact of the group's principal risks on the group's cash flow projections, including within the reasonable worst case forecast;

-  assessing consistency of cash flow forecasts with the cash flow forecasts used for the purposes of goodwill impairment reviews, long term viability assessment and recognition of deferred tax assets;
-  assessing the reasonableness of the reverse stress test scenario;
-  assessing and challenging the assumptions used by the directors in each of the cash flow forecasts, considering our own expectations based on our knowledge of the group;
-  assessing and challenging the key mitigating actions available including a reduction in capital expenditure and lower dividends pay-outs;
-  obtaining direct confirmations from banks of the value, duration and terms for the group's undrawn committed facilities at the date of signing these financial statements and the terms thereof;
-  recalculating the cash headroom available using undrawn committed facilities in each of the scenarios prepared by management and approved by the directors and testing the integrity and mechanical accuracy of the going concern model; and
-  assessing the appropriateness of the financial statement disclosures related to going concern.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group's and parent company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

In relation to the reporting on how the group has applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.

## 5. Key audit matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

## 5.1. Prepaid and mobile money revenue

## Key audit matter description

As set out in note 6 to the financial statements, revenue of $4,979m (March 2023: $5,255m) is derived from the provision of voice, data, mobile money and other services. Voice and data services account for $3,913m (March 2023: $4,278m) of revenue and mobile money services account for $649m (March 2023: $540m).

Most voice and data revenue derives from customers who subscribe to services on a prepaid basis. Mobile money revenue relates to the commission earned on allowing customers to add and transfer funds and make payments via the group's mobile money IT platform, Mobiquity. The group's accounting policies on prepaid and mobile money revenue are set out in note 2.19.

Due to the complexity of the group's revenue recording systems (in particular the Intelligent Network (IN) system for prepaid revenue and Mobiquity for mobile money) and the volume of customer data, we identified a key audit matter relating to prepaid revenue, specifically: (i) the accuracy of tariffs in the applicable systems; and (ii) the manual revenue reconciliation process from the billing system to the general ledger and the resulting manual journal entries. For mobile money, we identified a key audit matter in relation to the accuracy of rates and tariffs within the Mobiquity system. Errors in group's revenue recording system would impact the accuracy of prepaid and/ or mobile money revenue. Given the above, and the risk that prepaid and mobile money revenue could be manipulated to improve the group's financial performance, we identified this area as a fraud risk.

We performed the following procedures in response to the key audit matter :

-  with the involvement of our IT specialists we obtained an understanding of the IT environment in which the revenue recording systems reside, including interface controls between different IT applications. This included the IN billing system for prepaid revenue and the Mobiquity IT platform for mobile money;
-  obtaining an understanding of, and testing, the relevant controls over the approval and maintenance of new plans in the IN billing system and authorisation of rate changes and the maintenance of rates within the IN and Mobiquity systems;
-  testing the reconciliation process between the general ledger and IN and Mobiquity including any manual adjustments posted;
-  for prepaid revenue, testing a sample of call record validations and data usage to test the accuracy of prepaid revenue and the resolution of exceptions in addition to performing independent call testing to evidence that the amounts charged to the subscriber are consistent with the approved tariffs;
-  for mobile money, testing a sample of wallet transactions to test the accuracy of mobile money revenue and resolution of exceptions in addition to performing independent wallet testing to evidence that the amounts charged to the subscribers are consistent with the approved tariffs;
-  assessing key movements in prepaid revenue recorded within the general ledger against cash collection in the billing systems at the group level;
-  for prepaid revenue, testing a sample of tariffs set up and amendments within the IN system;
-  for mobile money, testing a sample of tariffs set up and amendments within the Mobiquity system; and
-  recomputing mobile money revenue based on the transaction volumes and the applicable transaction rates.

Based on the work performed, we consider mobile money and prepaid revenue to be accurately recorded and that prepaid revenue has been recorded in the correct period.
