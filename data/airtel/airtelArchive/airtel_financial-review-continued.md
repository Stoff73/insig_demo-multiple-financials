## Translation impact on net debt

Translation impact on net debt primarily represents the reduction in local currency cash, borrowings and lease liabilities in US dollar terms, arising from devaluation of local currencies (primarily Nigerian naira) against the reporting currency, i.e., US dollar. This impact is included in 'other comprehensive income - foreign currency translation reserve' in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
