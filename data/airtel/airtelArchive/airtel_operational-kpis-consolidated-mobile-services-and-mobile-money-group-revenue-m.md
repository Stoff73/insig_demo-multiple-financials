## Performance

In reported currency, total revenue declined by 5.3% to $4,979m and ARPU declined from $3.3 to $2.8 due to currency devaluation (primarily the Nigerian naira devaluation).

In constant currency, total revenues increased by 20.9%, driven by both customer base growth of 9.0% and ARPU growth of 10.7%. There was growth across all reporting segments: mobile services revenue in Nigeria grew by 25.8%, in East Africa by 21.5% and in Francophone Africa by 9.2% (and voice revenue growth of 11.9% and data revenue up 29.2%). Mobile money revenue grew by 32.8%, driven by 36.0% growth in East Africa and 22.3% in Francophone Africa. ARPU growth of 10.7% was driven by all our key services: with data contributing 6.0%, voice contributing 1.1%, mobile money contributing 3.3%, respectively.

## Our market environment

## A clear runway for growth.

Across sub-Saharan Africa, demand for data, mobile voice and mobile money services continues to grow, driven by a young and growing population seeking better connections with each other, and with economic opportunity.

For the vast majority of the 1.2 billion people in sub-Saharan Africa, mobile services are the first and often only way they have to access telecoms, internet and banking services. Demand from individuals and businesses continues to rise across the region - and there is a clear opportunity to increase the reach and penetration of affordable voice, data and mobile money services, include more people in the digital economy, and help support sustainable development on the continent. While the region has continued to experience economic and political turbulence this year with conflicts, currency fluctuations and inflationary shocks disrupting several markets and influencing consumers' spending - growth in telecoms remains robust. The GSMA forecasts that there will be more than 200 million additional unique mobile subscribers in sub-Saharan Africa by 2030, and that mobile data traffic will quadruple by 2028 1 .

## Mobile services: connecting individuals, societies and economies

Landline infrastructure, traditional banking services and broadband penetration levels are far lower in sub-Saharan Africa than in much of the world. This means that mobile networks serve as critical communications infrastructure for a region which will see the world's fastest growth in working age population over the next three decades . Connectivity and penetration are still relatively low - mobile penetration is forecast to reach 50% by 2030, compared to a global average of 73% - so our focus on expanding our networks and extending rural coverage plays a vital role in including people in the mobile and digital economies. In 2023/24, we invested $693m in capital expenditure, predominantly in our networks, and added around 3,000 sites to our network while growing our customer base by 9%.

## Data and digitalisation: at the heart of economic growth

Businesses and service providers rely on secure, competitively-priced data in order to prosper and generate economic value a fact reflected in the digitalisation ambitions of governments across the region.

Smartphone adoption in our markets continued to grow steadily in 2023/24 despite strong economic headwinds for customers in some markets, having passed 51% in 2022, according to GSMA. 4G coverage is expanding - our 4G network now reaches 70.7% of the people in our markets, up 4.9% since 2022/23 - and 5G is an emerging opportunity in urban areas.

We aim to be at the leading edge of this digital opportunity through our strategic focus on winning with data and our expanding digital products and content, and Airtel Business.

## Mobile money: continuing appetite for financial inclusion

Africa leads the world in mobile money services, and the continuing growth in mobile money in our markets has hugely expanded access to financial services for consumers and businesses, many of whom previously lacked access to traditional banks. This growth in financial inclusion is a key element in wider economic development and opportunity: financial inclusion is an enabler for seven of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals. And despite more than two decades of growth, the appetite for mobile money in sub-Saharan Africa remains strong - the region outperformed the global averages for new accounts and transaction volume growth in GSMA's 2022 survey.

We continue to build the mobile money ecosystems that help customers join the digital economy, and to win new customers through services including inter-operability, payments, microloans and international money transfers.

- For more information about our mobile money business, see pages 44-45

## Affordability is key, especially during economic disruption

Local and global economic turbulence have been keenly felt by consumers in some of our markets, accentuated by currency shortages or devaluations, supply chain disruption and political volatility - including changes of governments in several markets. While demand continues to increase, the rate of growth across the sector slowed in 2023/24, heightening competition. Affordability remains very important to consumers, in a competitive landscape that continues to be dominated by a few large competitors, with some smaller regional companies in some markets.

We offer transparent pricing plans based on the principle of 'more for more' - meaning that the cost of connecting continues to fall in real terms. We also compete through our range of services, our advertising and brand image, the quality and reliability of our service, and our wide network coverage. Our focus on distribution is designed to give us competitive advantage in recruiting and winning new customers. We reached 152.7 million customers in 2023/24 - and we're increasing our focus on customer retention as well as recruitment, with a particular emphasis on 4G customers.

- For more information about our 'Win with' strategy, see pages 24-33

## Focusing on the opportunity in our largest market, Nigeria

Nigeria encapsulates the opportunity we see across our markets, with its digital-first, very young, 220 million+ population, and a powerful appetite for data that reflects the country's ambition to be a digital powerhouse. Nigeria is widely expected to be the third most populous nation in the world by 2050, reflecting the very compelling runway for growth. However, the effects of currency devaluation and inflation in 2023/24 have had a significant impact on the telecoms sector as a whole, and on the wider economy. In June 2023, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) announced structural changes to the operations in the Nigerian Foreign Exchange (FX) market which contributed to a substantial devaluation of the Nigerian naira. Combined with subsequent devaluations, this led to the Nigerian naira devaluing during the reporting year. Inflation in Nigeria peaked at 33.2% in March 2024.

The structural changes in the Nigerian economy, including steps taken by the government to curtail inflation and provide a more stable foreign exchange environment, have the potential to strengthen the country's economy in the medium to long term. Since the start of 2024/25, the availability of US dollars in Nigeria has improved. However, as Nigeria is our largest market, where we serve more than 50 million customers, these currency headwinds had a material impact on our financial performance in reported currency terms in 2023/24, as described in our financial review on page 50. In constant currency, however, our continued investment into maintaining and modernising our 4G network, whilst also expanding our distribution network, has enabled year-onyear revenue growth of 25.9% in 2023/24 reinforcing our commitment to capitalise on this significant opportunity, grow our services in Nigeria, and continue to enable its digital transformation.

- For more information, see our financial review on pages 48-55

## Managing risk

To capitalise on the growth potential in our markets, our risk management processes need to be very robust.

Our risk management framework, wide geographical spread, deep knowledge of the African continent and governance policies ensure we're able to effectively mitigate risks while pursuing growth opportunities. Furthermore, we continue to be a partner in development with our various stakeholders on the continent through the implementation of our sustainability strategy, with significant commitments to achieving digital and financial inclusion and ensuring effective environmental stewardship through our net zero ambition.

## Working with governments and regulators

The telecoms sector operates within the frameworks created by governments and regulatory authorities, which include telecoms regulations, banking regulations and licences, all of which evolve rapidly. As well as strict compliance with regulations, we aim to work collaboratively with governments to make sure we integrate our services into their key initiatives for communications and sustainable development and play our part in strengthening economies and transforming lives.

Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations apply in most markets, requiring customers to register their identity to access mobile services. Providing easy access to a fast and compliant registration process is a key part of our 'Win with distribution' approach. Data security is another concern for regulators and consumers - and as part of our sustainability strategy, we operate under the 'Information Security Management System' (ISO 27001) certification and the 'Business Continuity Management System' (ISO 22301) certification, which cover all mobile communication and mobile money operations.

## Legal and regulatory frameworks

We operate within the laws and regulatory frameworks of governments and regulatory agencies in our markets and we always work to ensure that our operations meet local legal and regulatory requirements.

We engage with governments and regulatory authorities to promote a stable business environment that supports governments' goals for the sector and the long-term viability of our business, as we provide critical communications infrastructure and enable digital and financial inclusion.

The legal and regulatory frameworks we work within fall into three categories: telecoms services, mobile financial services and broadcasting services. In some of our markets, there are also competition laws. Frameworks are unique to each country, and they constantly evolve - so we keep them under continuous review, and publish significant developments on www.airtel.africa, under 'Regulatory news'.

To ensure compliance with the laws and regulatory frameworks, regulators in a number of markets have carried out audits and reviews during the year. These audits largely related to Know Your Customer (KYC) and quality of service compliance. Central banks across our markets have also increased their oversight of issues including governance, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing, with audits being undertaken in some markets.

Here we describe the most significant developments in our largest markets this year.

## Know Your Customer (KYC)

## Uganda

The Regulation of Interception of Communications Regulations, 2023 was enacted on 12 May 2023, making it a requirement to have all customers submit biometric information to their mobile network operators by 12 November 2023. This requirement has been implemented by the company.

## Chad

In August 2023, the Government of Chad issued an Order establishing new rules for identifying subscribers, requiring that operators collect full KYC details in respect of each customer within three months of the Order. The rules also limit the number of SIM-cards to three per customer. We're complying with this requirement.

## Nigeria

In December 2023, the Government of Nigeria issued directives requiring full barring of all MSISDNs (mobile station international subscriber directory numbers) without National Identification Numbers (NIN) as well as verification of all NINs used for SIM registration against the national database. Operators were required to comply with these directives in stages at various dates, with the final date for SIM barring set for 31 July 2024.

## Mobile termination regulation

## Rwanda

On 14 October 2023, the regulator in Rwanda set the asymmetrical mobile termination rate (MTR) for calls terminating on Airtel Rwanda's network at 2 Rwandan francs (RWF), and 1.5 RWF for those terminating on MTN Rwanda's network. This related to all calls for the period to July 2023 from 1 January 2023 (backdated). The same decision set the MTR rate for the period from August 2023 to August 2024, at 0 RWF for both mobile operators.

## The Republic of the Congo

In October 2023, the regulator in the Republic of Congo set an asymmetric MTR in favour of Airtel Congo S.A. The rate was set at an asymmetric MTR of 7 Central African Francs (CFA) to terminate on Airtel Congo S.A.'s network, and 5 CFA to terminate on MTN's network.

## Licences

Our services require a range of licences which are periodically issued, renewed or modified. In 2023/24 these included:

## The Democratic Republic of the Congo

On 7 June 2023, the DRC Government awarded a submarine cable landing licence to Mawezi RDC S.A, a joint-venture (JV) company, with the two partners being Airtel RDC S.A. and Orange RDC S.A. The licence allows the JV company to land and operate the '2Africa' submarine cable in the DRC.

## Kenya

On 15 June 2023, the Communications Authority of Kenya (CA) awarded Airtel Kenya Telesonic Limited a Network Facility Provider - Tier 2 Licence.

On 30 August 2023, Airtel Networks Kenya Limited received a Submarine Cable Landing Rights Licence for the '2Africa' submarine cable. The licence allows Airtel Africa to land and operate the '2Africa' submarine cable in Kenya.

## Malawi

On 7 February 2024, the Malawi Communications Regulatory Authority (MACRA) approved the renewal of Airtel Malawi plc's Network Services Licence, Application Service Licence and Network Facilities Service Licence for ten years.

## Rwanda

On 15 April 2023, the Rwanda Utilities and Regulatory Authority (RURA) issued Airtel Rwanda Limited with a modified licence, at no additional cost, following the amendment of the broadband policy that resulted in the liberalisation of access to 4G, 5G and future technologies for all mobile network operators.

## Uganda

On 19 July 2023 the Uganda Communications Commission (UCC) awarded Airtel Uganda Telesonic Limited a National Public Infrastructure Provider Licence for 15 years.

## Zambia

On 12 July 2023, the Zambia Information and Communications Technology Authority (ZICTA) issued Airtel Zambia Telesonic Limited with a network licence and service licence for 15 years.

## Madagascar

In April 2023, the Government of Madagascar introduced a global licence allowing Airtel Madagascar to offer a suite of telecom services and removing the restriction of access to certain market segments such as wholesale and national fibre capacity reselling.

## Spectrum developments

We acquire or renew spectrum to expand or maintain our ability to provide services. This year this included:

## Nigeria

On 9 May 2023, Airtel Networks Nigeria Limited renewed its 2100MHz (2x10 MHz) spectrum licence at a price of $127m for a period of 15 years.

## Uganda

On 1 July 2023, the Uganda Communications Commission (UCC) awarded Airtel Uganda Limited spectrum in the 800MHz (2 (2x5)) and the 3500MHz (1x1000) bands for the remaining duration of its National Telecommunication Operator's Licence, at no upfront cost.

## Tax and finance developments

Several governments reviewed their tax and levy requirements in 2023/24, including:

## Chad

With effect from 1 January 2024, the Finance Act 2024 banned the use of airtime as a cash equivalent. The law also modified the regulatory framework to make tax of 0.1% applicable on money transfers and withdrawals.

## Kenya

The Finance Act 2023 introduced tax changes which came into effect on 1 July 2023. They included an increase of VAT on fuel from 8% to 16%, an increase of excise duty on mobile money transfers from 12% to 15%, and a reduction of excise duty on voice and data services from 20% to 15%.

## Niger

The Finance Act 2022 introduced a stamp duty of 2% of the value of the invoice of each contract that mobile operators enter into with suppliers, increasing the cost of doing business in Niger. The Government of Niger repealed this tax provision with effect from 1 January 2024.

## Nigeria

The Finance Act 2023 was passed on 1 May 2023 to support the Federal Government's budget. The act maintained the 5% excise duty on telecommunication services. However, the implementation of this tax was suspended by the Federal Government.

## Tanzania

Under the Finance Act 2023, on 1 July 2023, a mobile money levy of approximately 23% was removed from P2P, bank-to-wallet and wallet-to-bank transactions. However, the mobile money levy was increased by 50% on 'cash out' transactions.

The Universal Communication Access Fund Act was amended to increase the levies that all telecommunication operators pay from 1% of operators' annual revenues to 1.25% starting from 1 July 2023, and from 1.25% to 1.5% starting from July 2025.

## Listing and shareholding developments

## The Democratic Republic of the Congo

By a Ministerial Order dated 10 October 2023, operators were given ten years to comply with the law that requires that all telecom licensees have a 30% local shareholding.

## Kenya

On 18 August 2023, the Government of Kenya removed the requirement for 30% local shareholding for licensees operating in the telecoms sector, with immediate effect.

## Malawi

Companies listed on the main board of the Malawi Stock Exchange (MSE) are required to have a minimum public float of 25%. Airtel Malawi plc has currently listed only 20% of its shares on the MSE. On 6 April 2023, the MSE granted Airtel Malawi plc a further period of three years within which to comply with the 25% public float requirement.

## Uganda

On 7 November 2023, Airtel Uganda listed 10.89% of its shares on the Uganda Securities Exchange (USE) in compliance with Uganda Communications (Fees and Fines) (Amendment) Regulations 2020, which created an obligation for all national telecom operator licensees to list 20% of their shares on the USE. The USE granted Airtel Uganda an extension until 6 November 2026 to offer the shortfall to achieve the 20% listing.

Our strategy

## Our 'Win with' strategy

Our 'Win with' strategy aims to deliver long-term value for all our stakeholders. It is accelerated by our drive for digitalisation, and underpinned by the detailed framework of environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) objectives in our sustainability strategy.

We're transforming lives across sub-Saharan Africa through products, services and programmes that foster financial inclusion , drive digitalisation and empower our 152.7 million customers and their communities. Our business objective is clear: to grow market share profitably and create superior enterprise value while delivering our sustainability strategy, so we can continue to pursue our vision of enriching the lives of our customers.

Our 'Win with' strategy has six strategic pillars through which we deliver sustainable, profitable growth. Connecting all these pillars are two constant themes: digitalisation, and our commitment to contributing to sustainable development through our sustainability strategy. We execute our strategy through a lean, efficient business model, built around a strong balance sheet and conservative capital structure.

We aim to act as a responsible business at all times - and to deliver on our promises. That means doing business transparently and with a sound governance structure. It also means being a good partner and an active contributor to society, by creating jobs, paying taxes and respecting the environment.

We work in partnership with the governments and institutions of the countries in which we operate to develop and deliver our strategy - which helps them realise their goals for sustainable development while ensuring our strict and continued compliance with local laws and regulations.

## Our six strategic pillars

<!-- image -->

- We report our progress against our sustainability  strategy in our Sustainability Report 2024 and on pages 56-70
- Our ambition is to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. We published our ' Journey towards a net zero future' in 2023 for further details, visit www.airtel.africa
- Disciplined risk management is essential to delivering our strategy. We describe our approach and principal risks on pages 72-79

## Our strategy continued

## Win with technology

<!-- image -->

We aim to create a leading, modernised network that provides the data capacity to meet rapidly growing demand and supports connectivity and digitisation in our markets.

That means improving basic network uptime, quality and resilience as well as expanding our network footprint and our 4G capabilities, while developing our 5G capacity.

## Our priorities

Expanding the reach of 4G coverage and building capacity through our 2G&gt;3G&gt;4G approach

Investing in 5G spectrum to make our network future-ready

Focusing on rural coverage expansion through new site rollouts, recognising that access to a reliable service is the critical first step for reaching previously underserved communities

Focusing on our network resilience and service continuity , and adding capacity through aggregation

Building and modernising our network through optimal end-to-end design , including spectrum addition

## Our progress

Our goal is to be the market leader everywhere we operate, while continuing to include more people in our network, particularly in underserved rural areas. This year we made significant investments in our network, technology and spectrum.

We continue to focus on delivering best-inclass service and 4G networks in our markets, while ensuring our network is ready for future 5G demand. This year we added over 4,300 4G sites and added approximately 5,000 km of fibre. Data capacity increased by 32.7%.

## 921

new sites added in rural areas in 2023/24

## How we measure progress

We measure progress through several KPIs, described on pages 16-17, including:

through simplified digital customer onboarding processes, including the Know Your Customer (KYC) process

Cross-selling new digital services to our existing customer base

Broadening our offer to enhance usage and ARPU, while further improving our approach to distribution so we can focus faster and more responsively on the needs and issues of customers in smaller geographies, increasing our customer reach

## Our progress

We've continued to expand our distribution network to get closer to customers and increase our visibility, developing our infrastructure and growing our customer base.

We expanded our ecosystem of customer activation outlets from over 304,200 to over 363,800 this year, while continuing to enhance our digital distribution capability, and remaining focused on MyAirtel app and other self-serve functionality. Fast, effective digital onboarding is a continuing priority, bringing new customers to our service in ways that are 100% compliant with local Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements while being as efficient as possible, including by recording biometric information where this is a requirement. Most onboarding processes are achieved in five minutes or less.

Our customer base grew by 9.0% to

## Our progress

Success in our 'Win with data' pillar is closely linked to our ability to extend and maintain fast, reliable networks and to serve our customers through our distribution organisation. This year we saw the number of data customers rise to over 64 million.

Our focus has resulted in an increase in smartphone penetration from 36.3% in 2022/23 to 40.5% in 2023/24, while providing an expanded network of 4G and 5G coverage.

Data volumes grew by 45.5% year on year, and 4G handsets now contribute 81% of this data usage, compared to 75% in 2022/23. Data usage per 4G data customer now exceeds 8.5 GB per month.

To keep customers' data secure, we hold certification in 'Information Security Management System' (ISO 27001), and 'Business Continuity Management System' (ISO 22301), which cover all mobile communication and mobile money operations in all our markets.

## Our priorities

## Further strengthening our distribution

## Our progress

Despite facing the challenges of high inflation and currency devaluation, particularly in Malawi, Nigeria and Zambia, we've widened our customer base and driven increased revenue while substantially increasing the reach and depth of our mobile money offer. Airtel Money is becoming the currency of choice in a number of markets, and our microloan and international money transfer (IMT) products have helped drive revenue, growing by 48% and 29%, respectively. To expand and enhance our IMT business, we've formed partnerships with Ria and Remitly.

We continue to monitor and adapt to evolving regulatory frameworks, applying strong compliance and data security controls. We've also maintained our focus on our distribution network and float availability through our Airtel Money branches and kiosks, which in 2023/24 expanded by 1,200 to reach 49,200. Our customer base grew to 38 million.

We aim to achieve an efficient operating model, leading to an effective cost structure and improved margins. This year we've increased our focus on adoption of energy efficient methods to achieve dual objectives: improve cost efficiency and eliminate hazardous waste from our operations by 2040.

## Our priorities

Rollout of telecommunication sites which are less dependent on carbon fuel through partnerships with towercos and deployment of lithium-ion batteries on our own sites

Collaboration with towercos to adopt renewable energy sources , such as solar and other environmentally friendly solutions

Deployment of multiband radios on our network to optimise the energy requirement on the sites (as opposed to dedicated radios for each technology/spectrum)

Ensuring fail-safe network design with optimal cost structures through multiple fibre routes and high capacity IRUs

Increasing availability of digital recharges and self care services

## Our progress

Our cost model aims to ensure that we can provide substantial additional capacity to serve customers in all our markets at marginal additional cost. We do this through optimising our network design, a constant focus on value in our inputs and our contracts, and volume optimisation.

## Our strategy continued

Customer service is at the heart of our success in Zambia.

## Our strategy in action

Winning - and repaying - the trust of our customers is a key driver of performance in our markets. In Zambia, where we've led the market in mobile services and mobile money for several years, we continued to build on our market presence in 2023/24, growing our overall customer base by 12% and delivering strong margins despite the headwinds of devaluation and inflation.

Service to customers was at the heart of this performance. Every one of our customers in Zambia receives 4G coverage or higher and by offering high-speed, reasonablypriced and reliable data, customer data usage grew by 48.5% in 2023/24. At the same time, our focus on distribution helped drive the usage of Airtel Money services, which now have an annual transaction value that, at $27bn, is almost equal to Zambia's GDP. In 2023/24, our Airtel Money customer base grew by 21.1%.

For our customers, availability, accessibility and affordability are key. We're proud that 49.5% of mobile money customers are women, supporting the Zambian Government's national financial inclusion strategy as well as Airtel Africa's own commitment to the financial empowerment of women.

And we're pleased to see how Airtel Money is enabling entrepreneurs to help foster economic activity across Zambia, with our annual merchant transaction value growing by over 90% in 2023/24. Together, our focus on winning with mobile money, technology and distribution saw Airtel Zambia outgrow inflation and deliver 35% revenue growth in 2023/24 with an EBITDA margin of 63.9%.

Airtel Africa plc Annual Report and Accounts 2024

## Our strategy in action

Our markets offer the opportunity for rapid growth - provided we retain a sharp focus on delivering our strategy, and a relentless emphasis on customer service.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is an underpenetrated market where a young and often unbanked population shows a strong appetite for mobile money services - and where our teams have shown how we can accelerate financial inclusion and grow our Airtel Money business by ensuring customers can easily access our services in more places than ever.

As a result, this year our Airtel Money customer base has expanded to beyond 3.6 million from 2.6 million in 2022/23, and Airtel Money revenues in the DRC grew by 31% year on year in 2023/24. At t he same time, our voice and data customer base also benefited from our focus on distribution, with over 1.3 million net customer additions in 2023/24.

In 2023/24, we more than doubled the number of Airtel Money agents in the DRC and transformed the way customers used our recharge services by promoting self-recharge and ensuring our existing recharge selling outlets were also Airtel Money outlets, with SIM cards on sale. We supported the opening of conventional bank branches to increase the availability of cash in remote areas, and harnessed the reach of our voice distribution teams to increase the recruitment and service of customers across the country.
