## Performance highlights

## Impact of Nigerian naira devaluation on financial results

## Operating key performance indicators (KPIs)

-  Total customer base grew by 9% to 152.7 million, as penetration of mobile data and mobile money services continue to rise, driving a 17.8% increase in data customers to 64.4 million and a 20.7% increase in mobile money customers to 38 million.
-  Constant currency ARPU growth of 10.7% was largely driven by increased usage across voice, data, and mobile money.
-  Mobile money transaction value increased by 38.2% in constant currency to reach over $112bn in reported currency.

## Financial performance

-  Revenue in constant currency grew by 20.9% while in reported currency revenue declined by 5.3% to $4,979m reflecting the impact of currency devaluation in several key markets, most significantly in Nigeria, our largest market. The Nigerian naira devalued from NGN461 per US dollar as on 31 March 2023 to NGN1,303 per US dollar as on 31 March 2024.
-  All segments continue to deliver double-digit constant currency growth. Across the Group, mobile services revenue grew by 19.4% in constant currency, driven by voice revenue growth of 11.9% and data revenue growth of 29.2%. Mobile money revenue grew by 32.8%, driven primarilly by continued strong growth in East Africa.
-  Constant currency EBITDA increased by 21.3% while reported currency EBITDA declined by 5.7% due to the impact of currency devaluation. EBITDA margin was 48.8%, 22bps lower than in the prior period, primarily due to the impact of rising fuel prices and inflationary pressures in some of our key markets.
-  Loss after tax was $89m, primarily impacted by significant foreign exchange headwinds, particularly the $549m exceptional loss after tax following the Nigerian naira devaluation in June 2023 and three month period ended 31 March 2024 and the Malawian kwacha devaluation in November 2023.
-  EPS before exceptional items was 10.1 cents, a decline of 25.9%. Basic EPS at negative 4.4 cents compared to 17.7 cents in the prior period. Both EPS before exceptional items and basic EPS were primarily impacted by the significant derivative and foreign exchange losses during the reporting period.

## Capital allocation

-  Capex was broadly flat at $737m, marginally below our guidance largely due to a deferral in data cetre investments. In addition, we invested $152m in licence renewal and spectrum acquisition, including $127m for the 3G licence renewal in Nigeria.
-  Leverage of 1.4x, as of 31 March 2024, was flat from the previous period. The remaining debt at HoldCo is now $550m, falling due in May 2024. Cash at HoldCo was around $680m at the end of the period and the Group is expecting to fully repay the HoldCo debt when due using this cash.
-  Considering the cash accretion at the HoldCo level, the current leverage and the consistent strong operating cash generation, the Board of directors approved a share buy-back programme of up to $100m which will take place over a period of up to 12 months. On 1 March 2024, we announced the commencement of the first tranche of the buy-back up to a maximum of $50m. During March 2024, the company purchased 7.4 million shares at a total consideration of $9m.

The Board of directors has recommended a final dividend of 3.57 cents per share, making the total dividend for the financial year 2023/24 5.95 cents per share.

As we operate in 14 markets across Africa, currency headwinds have often affected our results, but the last year has been exceptional - particularly in our largest market, Nigeria. In June 2023, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) announced structural changes to the operations in the Nigerian Foreign Exchange (FX) market, including the abolishment of segmentation, with all segments now collapsing into the Investors and Exporters (I&amp;E) window and the reintroduction of the 'willing buyer, willing seller' model at the I&amp;E window. The decision was taken to improve US dollar liquidity in the market and contribute to a more stable FX market.

Furthermore, in January 2024, the FMDQ Securities Exchange, overseeing FX trading in Nigeria, changed its methodology for calculating the Nigerian naira exchange rate, which led to a further devaluation. These events, combined with additional headwinds during the year, contributed to a significant devaluation of the Nigerian naira over the year from 461 per US dollar to 1,303 per US dollar on 31 March 2024. The availability of US dollars in Nigeria has improved significantly over the period.

## Revenue and EBITDA

Despite constant currency revenue and EBITDA growth in Nigeria of 25.9% and 30.8% respectively, the Nigerian naira devaluation had a materially negative impact on reported currency results. The impact of the Nigerian naira devaluation since March 2023 on reported revenue and EBITDA for the period ending 31 March 2024 was $1,042m and $554m respectively. As the US dollar appreciation occurred at various stages during the year, revenue and EBITDA in the reporting period does not reflect the full year impact. As a result, the next financial year reported currency results will continue to reflect the currency headwinds experienced during FY'24.

If the closing exchange rate of 1,303 NGN/USD were to be used to consolidate the results of the Group for the year ended 31 March 2024, reported revenue would have declined further by $603m to $4,376m (16.7% YoY decline) as opposed to the 5.3% decline reported. Similarly, EBITDA would have declined further by $324m to $2,104m (18.3% YoY decline) as opposed to the 5.7% decline reported, with an EBITDA margin of 48.1%. EBITDA margins have been negatively impacted by approximately 70bps over the year ended 31 March 2024 because of the reduced Nigeria contribution to Group.

## Finance costs and profit after tax

All US dollar-linked liabilities in Nigeria have been translated at the closing rate of NGN1,303 per US dollar on 31 March 2024, which led to a $1,070m charge to finance costs under 'derivatives and foreign exchange losses', out of which $770m has been classified as exceptional. After adjusting for the tax impact, the Nigeria exceptional devaluation impact on finance costs resulted in $520m impact on profit after tax.

Nigeria remains our biggest market, fundamental to our overall strategy across Africa. We discuss the opportunity inherent in the Nigerian market in the market environment section on pages 38-39. We continue to look at ways to mitigate against currency volatility on our reported performance by continuing to drive strong constant currency revenue growth, identifying cost optimisation initiatives and reducing our exposure to US dollar liabilities.
