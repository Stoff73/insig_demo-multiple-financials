## Alternative performance measures (APMs)

## Introduction

In the reporting of financial information, the directors have adopted various APMs. These measures are not defined by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and therefore may not be directly comparable with other companies APMs, including those in the Group's industry.

APMs should be considered in addition to, and are not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, IFRS measurements.

## Purpose

The directors believe that these APMs assist in providing additional useful information on the underlying trends, performance and position of the Group.

APMs are also used to enhance the comparability of information between reporting periods and geographical units (such as like-for-like sales), by adjusting for non-recurring or uncontrollable factors which affect IFRS measures, to aid users in understanding the Group's performance. Consequently, APMs are used by the directors and management for performance analysis, planning, reporting and incentive-setting purposes.

The directors believe the following metrics to be the APMs used by the Group to help evaluate growth trends, establish budgets and assess operational performance and efficiencies. These measures provide an enhanced understanding of the Group's results and related trends, therefore increasing transparency and clarity into the core results of the business.

The following metrics are useful in evaluating the Group's operating performance:

Derivative and foreign exchange losses are due to revaluation of US dollar balance sheet liabilities and derivatives as a result of currency devaluation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

The Group views operating free cash flow as a key liquidity measure, as it indicates the cash available to pay dividends, repay debt or make further investments in the Group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

The Group defines leverage ratio as net debt divided by EBITDA for the preceding 12 months. The directors view net debt and the leverage ratio to be meaningful measures to monitor the Group's ability to cover its debt through its earnings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

The directors view ROCE as a financial ratio that measures the Group's profitability and the efficiency with which its capital is being utilised. The Group defines EBIT as operating profit/(loss) for the period. Capital employed is defined as sum of equity attributable to owners of the company (grossed up for put option provided to minority shareholders to provide them liquidity as part of the sale agreements executed with them during year ended 31 March 2022), non-controlling interests and net debt. Average capital employed is average of capital employed at the closing and beginning of the relevant period. For quarterly computations, ROCE is calculated by dividing EBIT for the preceding 12 months by the average capital employed (being the average of the capital employed averages for the preceding four quarters). |

*   New APM added during the year ended 31 March 2024.

Some of the Group's IFRS measures and APMs are translated at constant currency exchange rates to measure the organic performance of the Group. In determining the percentage change in constant currency terms, both current and previous financial reporting period's results have been converted using exchange rates prevailing as on 31 March 2023 for all countries, except Nigeria. For Nigeria the constant currency exchange rate used is 752.2 NGN/USD which is prevailing rate as on 30 June 2023.Reported currency percentage change is derived based on the average actual periodic exchange rates for that financial period. Variances between constant currency and reported currency percentages are due to exchange rate movements between the previous financial reporting period and the current period. The constant currency numbers only reflect the retranslation of reported numbers into exchange rates as of 31 March 2023 (Nigeria as of 30 June 2023) and are not intended to represent the wider impact that currency changes has on the business.

## Note on exceptional items:

'Exceptional items refer to items of income or expense within the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, which are of such size, nature or incidence that their exclusion is considered necessary to explain the performance of the Group and improve the comparability between periods. Reversals of previous exceptional items are also considered as exceptional items. When applicable, these items include amongst others, currency devaluation of local currencies against the US Dollar, network modernisation, share issue expenses, loan prepayment costs, the settlement of legal and regulatory cases, restructuring costs, impairments, gain on sale of tower assets and the initial recognition of deferred tax assets etc.

The Group has US Dollar liabilities in subsidiaries in which the US Dollar is not the functional currency. Changes in the US Dollar exchange rate against the relevant functional currency leads to foreign exchange gains or losses recorded in the statement of comprehensive income. With respect to the classification of whether these gains or losses, as a result of the devaluation of local currencies against the US Dollar, as an exceptional item, the Group presents the impact as an exceptional item only if a particular currency has devalued (or appreciated) due to a structural change in the local market (for example as a result of changes in government policy) or the devaluation in a month is more than a threshold percentage. The devaluation is also only reported as exceptional if the resultant impact on the Group's profit before tax is higher than a monetary threshold. Reversals of foreign exchange losses as a result of the above are also reported as exceptional. The Group continues to review its exceptional items policy to align it to changes in the macro-economic environment. For the current year, this did not have a change on the amounts reported as exceptional items.'

Financial data included in this document are presented in US dollars rounded to the nearest million. Therefore, discrepancies in the tables between totals and the sums of the amounts listed may occur due to such rounding. The percentages included in the tables throughout the document are based on numbers calculated to the nearest $1,000 and therefore minor rounding differences may result in the tables. Growth metrics are provided on a constant currency basis unless otherwise stated. The Group has presented certain financial information on a constant currency basis. This is calculated by translating the results for the current financial year and prior financial year at a fixed 'constant currency' exchange rate, which is done to measure the organic performance of the Group. Growth rates for our reporting regions and service segments are provided in constant currency as this better represents the performance of the business.

Growth rates for business and product segments are in constant currency as it better represents the underlying performance of the business. Constant currency growth rates for all the reported periods except 2023/24 is calculated using the closing exchange rate as at the end of the immediate prior reporting period. For instance, 2022/23 constant currency rate is closing exchange rate as of 31 March 2022. For 2023/24, constant currency growth rates are calculated using 31 March 2023 closing exchange rate for all reported regions and service segments except for Nigeria region and service segment. For the Nigeria region and service segment, constant currency growth rates have been calculated using 30 June 2023 closing exchange rate. In June 2023, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) announced changes to the operations in the Nigerian Foreign Exchange Market, including the abolishment of segmentation, with all segments now collapsing into the Investors and Exporters (I&E) window and the reintroduction of the 'Willing Buyer, Willing Seller' model at the I&E window. As a result of this CBNdecision, the Nigerian naira devalued against US Dollar by approximately 62%.

## Warning to shareholders ('boiler room' scams)

In recent years, many companies have become aware that their shareholders have received unsolicited calls or correspondence concerning investments. These callers typically make claims of highly profitable opportunities in UK investments that turn out to be worthless or simply do not exist. These approaches are usually made by unauthorised companies and individuals and are commonly known as 'boiler room' scams. Airtel Africa plc shareholders are advised to be extremely wary of such approaches and to only deal with firms authorised by FCA. See the FCA website at fca.org.uk/scamsmart for more information about this and similar activities.
