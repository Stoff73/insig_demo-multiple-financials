## Airtel Money strategy

<!-- image -->

## Overview

Sub-Saharan Africa has led the world in the adoption of mobile money, which is becoming the currency of choice in many of our markets, and the region continues to outperform global averages when it comes to key metrics such as transaction volume growth and new accounts. The digitalisation of formerly cash-based economies is bringing a wide range of benefits to societies and economies - especially to the many people who were previously unbanked and are now empowered by their connection to the financial services ecosystem.

Airtel Money is playing an important part in this transformation, helping individuals and businesses of all sizes take advantage of the opportunities presented by mobile money, and continuing to refine and expand our products and services, which include mobile wallet deposits and withdrawals, merchant payments, enterprise disbursements, international money transfers, and loans and savings.

As we describe below, we've seen excellent results in 2023/24, with 20.7% growth in our customer base, 38.2% growth in transaction value in constant currency and 32.8% growth in constant currency revenues. Distribution remains a key element of our strategy - our exclusive distribution infrastructure expanded by 37% - allowing us to scale up our customer base, which is also fuelled by our ability to recruit existing mobile services customers to mobile money products. In a year when several markets saw challenges around currency devaluations and inflation, this focus on customer recruitment and increased use cases was essential to continuing our track record of growth.

There were a number of highlights in the year. 'P2P' or person-to-person payments grew by 50%, and international money transfers increased by 40%, helped by our work to expand the receiving corridors for remittances to support partner remittance businesses in using Airtel Money wallets, including Ria and Remitly, which we agreed partnerships with this year. Our microloans services also grew strongly, with more eligible customers and higher loan values.

## Our performance

Mobile money revenue grew by 21.1% in reported currency, with constant currency growth of 32.8%. The differential in growth rates is primarily as the result of an average devaluation in Zambian kwacha (25.1%) and Malawi kwacha (32.6%), partially offset by appreciation in the Central African franc (4.1%). The constant currency mobile money revenue growth was driven by revenue growth in both East Africa and Francophone Africa of 36.0% and 22.3%, respectively. In Nigeria, the company remains focused on customer acquisition, with 1.5 million active customers registered for mobile money services in Nigeria at the end of March 2024. Additionally, we added approximately 153,000 agents during the year, reaching almost 205,000 agents as of 31 March 2024.

The constant currency revenue growth of 32.8% was driven by both customer base growth of 20.7% and mobile money ARPU growth of 8.6%. The expansion of our distribution network, particularly our exclusive channels of Airtel Money branches and kiosks, supported customer base growth of 20.7%. The mobile money ARPU growth of 8.6% was driven by transaction value per customer growth of 13.1% in constant currency, to $262 per customer per month.

Annualised transaction value amounted to $112bn in reported currency, with mobile money revenue contributing 16.8% of total Group revenue during the full year period ended 31 March 2024.

EBITDA was $436m, up by 26.8% and 39.0% in reported and constant currency, respectively. The EBITDA margin reached 52.1%, an improvement of 234 basis points in constant currency and 236 basis points in reported currency, driven by continued operating leverage.

## Partnering with Mastercard to connect subscribers across the world

In August 2023, we announced the launch of a new cross-border remittance service in partnership with Mastercard, which will enable Airtel subscribers across all our 14 markets to send and receive money safely and quickly. Mastercard cross-border services provides a single and secure point of access, allowing our subscribers to arrange transfers with mobile money wallets in more than 145 countries.

## Winning with mobile money in Malawi

Including more people in the financial services ecosystem - and giving them more accessible, affordable ways to use those services - is at the heart of winning with mobile money. In Malawi, Airtel Money is the market leader in this segment, relied on by government agencies and NGOs as well as millions of individuals and businesses - and our performance in 2023/24 continued to go from strength to strength.

A sharp increase of 31% in the number of Airtel Money agents in Malawi this year was combined with a strong marketing and visibility campaign, which included highlighting the convenience and speed of recharges and the way remittances can be received directly into Airtel Money wallets.

We grew our customer base in Malawi by 19% to 4.7 million in 2023/24, with Airtel Money recharges also growing fast, supporting an overall increase in revenues of 57% year on year in constant currency terms.

## 34%

annual revenue growth

Cloud adoption, quote-to-cash systems and other digitalisation trends are transforming the way business is done, and we offer mobile and fixed data services and a comprehensive suite of digital services to major corporates, non-governmental organisations, government departments, diplomatic missions, start-ups and small and mediumsized businesses (SMEs). That is underpinned by our business ICT support, including conferencing and collaboration services, cloud and data centre co-location services, and Airtel Money services. Furthermore, we can provide data sovereignty through our in-country data centres.

## Transformative progress on data centres, fibre and support for businesses

This year we made significant progress. Alongside the transformative launch of our new data centre business, Nxtra by Airtel (see on the right), we launched our Telesonic offer, which leverages Airtel Africa's 75,400+ km of terrestrial fibre cable assets and access to 12 submarine cables, including the 2Africa cable, to support data centres and other users who need high-speed internet or 5G coverage. Telesonic has now connected Africa overland - a breakthrough project that links Mombasa in Kenya with Muanda in the DRC and will significantly improve communications for customers in the DRC, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda.

We also saw significant growth in our enterprise business, which is particularly targeted at the region's small and mediumsized businesses, building our fibre or fixed wireless access sales through attractive packages and partnerships that enable bulk messaging services (SMS) and mobile-to-mobile (M2M) services.

By supporting our customers, we support opportunities for the people and businesses around us, while also creating value for Airtel Africa: this year, Airtel Business saw over 3x increase in fixed data connections, and our annual revenue grew by 34%.

## Nxtra by Airtel: accelerating Africa's digital transition

Trusted and sustainable data centres are at the heart of a flourishing digital economy - and key to meeting the hunger for data in our markets. In December 2023, we launched Nxtra by Airtel, our new data centre business, which will build one of the largest networks of high-capacity data centres in Africa. Coupled with our extensive fibre footprint, Nxtra will offer secure integrated data solutions to international businesses, large African enterprises, start-ups, SMEs and governments.

With a first centre now under construction in Lagos, Nigeria, Nxtra will expand to centres in major cities across our markets, boosting digital speeds and capacities and meeting data security and sovereignty requirements while enabling more local cloud services.

The Lagos centre will plan 34MW of total power and is expected to be live in mid-2025 - another big step on a journey to unlock our markets' digital potential and empower Africa's tech entrepreneurs.

Driving value creation by pioneering digital solutions, enhancing user experiences and boosting efficiency across our markets.

Digitalisation is a theme that connects every pillar of our 'Win with' strategy and Digital Labs plays an important role in making sure we deliver the innovation and efficiency that will help drive Airtel Africa's growth.

In Digital Labs, we develop and deliver technology platforms and digital products that the wider business can deploy to enhance customers' experiences, drive financial inclusion, and improve our processes. We work with voice and mobile services, Airtel Money and Airtel Business, and focus on digital consumer products, enterprise product engineering, fintech platforms, telco platforms and data analytics.

This year saw a number of projects delivered across the business.

In Nigeria, we helped develop a complete application suite to support our mobile money rollout, featuring a consumer app, a sales app for onboarding our SmartCash agents, a retailer app that the agents use to enrol customers and conduct transactions, and a contact centre portal for our call centres. The suite now supports 492,000 monthly users.

Across all 14 markets we launched a new sales app, which teams can use to plan field visits and monitor sales performance with the aim of driving further sales. And we also developed e-care, a tool for use by our Airtel Business customers to improve their experience of our service and their ability to self-help on our platforms.

We have built on the success of our retailer Tribe app, launched in 2022/23, which began as a tool to assist SIM card sales and swaps, and has now developed additional functionality, supporting home broadband sales in six markets as well as a range of market-specific functions in other countries. And in Rwanda, Digital Labs helped deliver the Airtel products involved in ConnectRwanda 2.0, a project that aims to expand access to affordable smartphones. For more information about digital inclusion in Rwanda, see page 58.

## Airtel Ads: shaping the communications landscape

We're in the business of connecting people - and in February 2024, we brought businesses in Nigeria closer to their customers through the launch of Airtel Ads, Africa's first integrated demand-side platform (DSP), which helps advertisers and agencies manage, purchase and optimise digital ad delivery in real time.

Airtel Ads draws on the strength of our customer base, reaching consumers on multiple devices and enabling advertisers to engage them through innovative AI technology, supported by our dedicated marketing team, data analytics and native language support.

## Self-service channels help drive growth

The rapid evolution of our digital self-service channels - MyAirtel and SmartCash apps - helps customers simplify their journeys and removes pain points so that they have a smoother, more accessible path to financial inclusion. We've drawn on AI to keep improving the customer experience, which has helped the apps enable over $3bn of transactional value for more than five million monthly digital active customers in 2023/24 a growth of 97% year on year.
