## Robust governance

Our robust governance mechanism has built resilience into our business and has uniquely shaped us to capitalise on market opportunities.

Sunil Bharti Mittal Chair

On behalf of the Board, I'm pleased to share our corporate governance report for the financial year 2023/24.

In this report, we give our investors and other stakeholders an insight into the governance activities of our Board and its committees over the past year.

Our Board acts in the long-term interests of our key stakeholders to achieve our purpose of transforming lives. Our corporate strategy drives our sustainable revenue growth. And our sustainability strategy underpins our social environmental and governance performance. We do our best to lead by example.

Over the past five years, by aligning our purpose, values, strategy and culture and enhancing our corporate reporting, we've demonstrated our commitment to transparency, stakeholder engagement and the highest standards of corporate governance and regulatory compliance. This year, we're publishing our Annual and Sustainability Reports at the same time - giving shareholders and other stakeholders a full overview of our financial and non-financial performance. These two reports have their own objectives, but together tell the story of how we continue to deliver our strategy, the transformative impact we have on people and society, and the people-focused approach we take to being a responsible business in Africa.

## Strategy

Overseeing and implementing our strategy are key responsibilities of the Board, and this was reflected in our activities throughout the year.

In October, the Board spent two days together reviewing the Group's 'Win with' strategy, which is underpinned by our sustainability strategy and designed to deliver long-term value for all our stakeholders. Both our strategy and our business model have shown their strength during a year in which some markets experienced strong political and economic headwinds. Inflationary pressures coupled with continuing FX shortages in Malawi and Nigeria presented significant challenges. Remaining focused on our growth strategy, strong operational execution and margin resilience enabled us to withstand formidable challenges during a period of unprecedented market volatility driven by macroeconomic and geopolitical factors.

The Board continued to make sure that our resourcing - our capital, finance and people - is sufficient to achieve our strategy while continually improving performance and diversity. For example, repaying the HoldCo debt, due in May 2024, will ensure the continued success of our balance sheet and derisking strategy. This positions Airtel Africa to meet the unique opportunities for telecoms and mobile money in sub-Saharan Africa, where customers and societies are still underserved by mobile, digital and banking services - such as our new data centre business, Nxtra by Airtel, launched in December 2023.

The Uganda Initial Public Offering (IPO) is an example of the Board continuing to support local shareholders and markets while meeting its regulatory obligations.

See page 99 for more detail on how the Board implemented our strategic goals during the year.

## Sustainability

Sustainability is absolutely critical to our 'Win with' strategy and a key focus area for our Board and leadership. We're making noteworthy progress on our ESG performance. I'm pleased to report that we're on track to deliver on our net zero emissions targets with the launch of our scope 3 commitment. We continue to work collaboratively with partners and stakeholders to achieve our sustainability goals, including through our landmark five-year partnership with UNICEF. This gives children access to free educational resources, with the goal of reaching one million children through our programmes by 2027. Our progress here not only reflects our commitment to corporate social responsibility, but also the remarkable contributions of our team members who make it possible.

## Enhancing diversity

The Board continues to support programmes and initiatives across the Group to nurture key talent and improve diversity and inclusion at all levels. We regularly review our recruitment processes to make sure they support our aims. We've made good progress this year in improving the gender balance of our wider senior leadership team, particularly at the country managing director and senior leadership level. During the reporting period, 35.4 % of new senior managers and above appointments were women, and our female representation increased to 28.3% from 26% in the previous financial year. We've again included a gender balance metric in our executive directors' variable pay scorecard to continue to improve the balance of our workplace.

## Remuneration

Last year, I wrote about the complexity and challenges when it comes to finding, attracting and retaining highly skilled people across all the countries in which we operate. While we do everything we can to apply good practices and fit within a UK compliance framework, we must balance our ambitions with the realities and demands of the highly competitive African market. In this light, I was pleased to see the Investment Association recently acknowledge that to operate on a level international playing field, FTSE companies need to be able to use greater discretion - both over the sums awarded in long-term incentive share schemes and the use of so-called hybrid plans incorporating restricted stock.

## An effective and improving Board

This year was also an active one for changes to our Board, as overseen by our Nominations Committee.

I'd particularly like to recognise the contributions of two Board members who stepped away this year. After joining the Bharti Airtel Limited Board as an independent director, Doug Baillie also retired from Airtel Africa. Over nearly five years, he consistently brought valuable insight, support and guidance as an independent director on our Board and chair of the Remuneration Committee. Doug carefully handed over the role of Remuneration Committee chair to Tsega Gebreyes, enabling a smooth transition. We're delighted that Doug remains connected to the wider Group and that we can continue to benefit from his expertise.

Kelly Bayer Rosmarin also left the Board in October 2023. She had served as a director for two years after being nominated by our controlling shareholder as per the terms of the relationship agreement.

John Danilovich has also informed the Board that he'll retire as an independent non-executive director at the end of this year's AGM in July 2024.

In January 2024, we announced that our CEO Olusegun (Segun) Ogunsanya would be retiring later in the year and that Sunil Taldar would be stepping into this critical role. Sunil joined Airtel Africa in October 2023 as our director of Transformation. After a transition period, on 1 July 2024 Sunil will become CEO and executive director on the Board and Segun will retire.

On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Segun for his huge commitment and contribution to Airtel Africa as CEO and before that as managing director and CEO of Nigeria, our largest market in Africa. Under Segun's leadership, we've maintained double-digit revenue growth and continued to deliver new, industry-leading products to our customers across Africa.

In addition, as Airtel Africa Charitable Foundation's inaugural chair, Segun will continue to build on his deep experience across Africa and his work as CEO, including his oversight of the launch of our sustainability strategy. The Charitable Foundation will accelerate our commitment to sustainability initiatives and charitable operations across Africa, in particular to promoting digital and financial inclusion, access to education and environmental protections.

Sunil Taldar brings with him more than 30 years' business management experience in the FMCG and telecoms sectors. We're delighted to welcome him as our next CEO.

Our most recent Board evaluation confirmed that our Board functions effectively. It is well balanced and diverse, with a strong mix of relevant skills and experience.

I'm grateful to all the members of the Board for their contributions, and particularly to the chairs of each committee for establishing and steering their respective committees during the year.

## Section 172 statement

We know that the long-term success of our business rests on how we work with our many stakeholders. To create and sustain value for all, we need to continue to engage effectively, create a productive working environment, and recognise various stakeholder views.

As this is the responsibility of our Board, this year we're sharing the detailed stakeholder disclosure in this governance report to explain how our Board engages both directly and indirectly with our key stakeholders.

## In conclusion

I remain confident that the Board is working effectively, ensuring the company continues to grow and meet the needs of people across Africa. We have the right balance of skills, expertise and professionalism to continue to deliver strong governance, while allowing the CEO and CFO to implement and deliver our strategy.

I very much look forward to meeting with shareholders at our AGM on Wednesday 3 July 2024, which will be live streamed from London. Along with all the directors attending the AGM, I'm available to respond to your questions, concerns and suggestions at any time.

## Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code

The Board continues to assess its approach to corporate governance by applying the Financial Reporting Council's UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code). We are reporting against the 2018 Code for the year ended 31 March 2024. For more details, visit frc.org.uk.

The Board confirms compliance against all 2018 Code provisions except for one: the independence of the chair on appointment (Provision 9). Our assessment of the chair's non-independence is set out on page 108. We continue to apply the Code's principles and uphold the spirit of the Code through the work of our Board and its committees.

The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) has published a revised version of the UK Corporate Governance Code and updated guidance to support the Governance Code. For the most part, the changes apply to financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2025, though companies will have an extra year to prepare for the changes being introduced in relation to reporting on internal controls. The Board is evaluating the impact of the Corporate Governance Code 2024 and will report on this in next year's report.

- For more detail on our Board structure and compliance with the Code, see our compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code section on pages 108-125

## Corporate governance

## Highlights for the year

We continued preparing Airtel Money for listing - see page 99 for details.

We published our second Sustainability Report alongside this Annual Report. This builds on the commitments set out in our 2021 sustainability strategy and underscores our commitment to zero carbon emissions by 2050. It shares of our journey to net zero and the addition of scope 3 emissions.

We published our third TCFD statement in line with LR 9.8.6R(8) requiring companies to share a clear statement of TCFD compliance and in keeping with our roadmap of last year. Our compliance with the climate-related financial disclosures in accordance with Sections 414CB of the UK Companies Act 2006, can be found in the strategic report, primarily in the TCFD and Risk reports on pages 63-79 and in our references to network resilience.

We improved and fine-tuned our business model to deliver our strategic ambition to transform lives through financial inclusion and empowerment across the African continent by rolling out a reliable network and providing affordable services to our customers - see pages 22-23 for our business model and see pages 24-33 for our strategy.

We're delivering on our senior leadership succession plan: we appointed a new CEO designate and made strategic additions of a new CEO, Airtel Business, a Francophone regional director and a chief legal officer to our ExCo to ensure we can continue to deliver our 'Win with' strategy.

We appointed our first woman operating country (OpCo) managing director: Anne Tchokonte joined as managing director of Airtel Madagascar in February 2024.

We're addressing the gender balance challenge across our OpCos by championing initiatives that support diverse talent and thought. These critical enablers of sustainable growth include the Airtel Africa mobility programme, the 'Women in technology' programme and the Airtel Academy - see page 117 for details.

We established new holding and subsidiary company structures for our Nxtra by Airtel data centre businesses in support of our 'Win with technology' strategy.

We conducted a comprehensive internally facilitated Board evaluation - see pages 106-107.

## A closer look at…

## Governance training for our subsidiary boards

The directors of our subsidiary businesses across Africa must meet the legal and regulatory obligations in their respective jurisdictions. It's their responsibility to make sure they always stay compliant. To this end, they receive training from external specialist advisors to understand their responsibilities. They also attend briefing sessions and have Board presentations and updates about regulations that directly affect the company.

During the financial year, our subsidiary company directors had the following training:

## Kenya

The directors and management of Airtel Networks Kenya had a sensitisation session on data privacy and protection from the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, Kenya.

As part of the Board's work to reach our sustainability commitments and to align culture and operations with this priority, directors also attended a briefing session facilitated by the sustainability lead in the company. This highlighted the activities being undertaken in the country towards compliance and the role of directors in reaching this.

## Uganda

Following Airtel Uganda's listing, the Uganda Stock Exchange (USE) facilitated a training session on listing requirements under the USE Listing Rules 2021 for the Board and management.

## Malawi

The new chair of Airtel Malawi plc had induction training with the managing director and members of ExCo. This gave an overview of the company and its operating environment, financial performance, and new regulatory, financial and risk developments.

During the year, we also facilitated internal training and alignment on good corporate governance practices and company secretarial duties for all company secretaries sitting on subsidiary Boards.

## A closer look at…

## Governing sustainability matters

Our sustainability strategy lies at the heart of our business, informing and influencing our corporate strategy at every stage. We have established and enhanced our governance structure so that sustainability is a core Board priority and responsibility. The delivery of the strategy and its goals is supported by dedicated workstreams led by sustainability goal-holders (ExCo members).

Our Board of directors has ultimate oversight of our sustainability strategy, its implementation across the business and the integration of related metrics into remuneration. The Board is updated on progress on a quarterly basis and approves actions as appropriate. The Board is also responsible for how we're managing climate-related risks and opportunities (CROs). It maintains this oversight through two of its committees: Sustainability and the Audit and Risk. The Sustainability Committee oversees the implementation of our sustainability strategy, while the Audit and Risk Committee oversees our management of risk, including how we assess and mitigate CROs.

<!-- image -->

For more on the work of the Sustainability Committee, see page 96 , and see our Sustainability Report 2024

Oversees sustainability strategy.

## Monitors non-financial KPIs.

Monitors ESG regulatory landscape and external reporting.

The Executive Committee is responsible for our sustainability strategy and vision at the Group level. It's also in charge of implementing the strategy in all 14 markets and managing the workstreams that follow from this.

The head of strategy and sustainability reports to the CEO and sits on the Sustainability Committee. He's directly responsible for integrating our sustainability strategy across the business. This includes coordinating workstreams across functions and markets, collecting and analysing data and reporting on sustainability. The sustainability team works closely with the ExCo to make sure that Airtel Africa is doing all it can to find innovative and economically effective ways to be more sustainable. The head of strategy and sustainability also leads in developing, implementing and monitoring environmental strategies across the company.

## The Board's focus in 2023/24

During the 2023/24 reporting period, our Board held six scheduled meetings, including the regular quarterly meetings, a strategy session and the AGM.

It also met an additional two times: first to consider our CEO succession plan, and again to review our full year financial statements and Annual Report approvals process and to approve our second Sustainability Report. We have good processes in place for running short and efficient additional virtual Board meetings to approve matters arising between meetings.

## Strategy

Reviewed our strategic plan and worked to make sure our strategy stays robust.

## Corporate governance continued

Discussed how the Audit and Risk Committee should be assessing and monitoring culture on an ongoing basis.

Took a closer look at:

-  Our Nigeria operations, including the longer-term consequences of the naira devaluation on pricing, reinvestment and growth

-  Smartcash PSB business and customer acquisition rates

## Strategy

Evaluated and debated strategy presentations from management during the strategy day, reviewed and approved our Group strategy and supported the sustainability strategy.

Continued to look at opportunities to create more value and expand our Airtel Money business to revolutionise the financial services landscape in Africa, particularly Nigeria.

Discussed and identified ways to be more entrepreneurial, while keeping the highest levels of governance and complying with all regulations. We achieve this by making business choices with the mindset of an entrepreneur while delivering with the resources available.

## Spectrum expansion

Established a Board working group to work with the CEO on spectrum auction matters, recognising the need to act quickly in auctions within agreed parameters.

Reviewed and revised our investment strategy for buying spectrum to support our 4G network capacity expansion across markets for both mobile data and fixed wireless home broadband capability, and for future 5G rollout. This provides significant capacity for continued strong data growth and reflects our continued confidence in the opportunities in our markets to support local communities and economies through digital inclusion and connectivity.

Continued to invest in spectrum across several markets to underpin growth ambitions. In Nigeria, we acquired 5G spectrum in the 3500 MHz band, and added to our 2600 MHz spectrum. We also acquired spectrum in the DRC, Kenya, Malawi, the Seychelles, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia, which will help us maximise network capacity and coverage.

Also invested in the renewal of 2100 MHz spectrum in Nigeria, following substantial spectrum acquisitions over the past year. This enhanced our network capacity and coverage and reflects our continued confidence in opportunities across the Nigerian market to support the local communities and economies through expanding digital inclusion and connectivity.

## Uganda spectrum

In June 2023, the Uganda Communications Commission confirmed that Airtel Uganda Limited had qualified for the award of the 800 MHz and 3500 MHz spectrum.

## Simplifying our capital structure

Following the capital reduction approval by shareholders at the 2023 AGM, which was subsequently sanctioned by the High Court of England and Wales, created distributable reserves that the company can use to facilitate returns to shareholders, whether in the form of dividends, distributions or buying Airtel Africa shares.

Made significant progress this year and in previous years to reduce leverage and strengthen our balance sheet.

Given the levels of cash accretion and reduced leverage, and considering our consistent strong operating cash generation, in early March the Board launched a share buy-back programme of up to $100m to run over 12 months. All purchased shares will be cancelled, leading to a reduction in issued share capital.

## Win with distribution

The Board continued to invest in strengthening our distribution network, with a focus on rural areas. We expanded our exclusive franchise stores, adding almost 28,000 kiosks and mini shops, and almost 1,600 Airtel Money branches (AMBs) across our footprint. We also added more than 59,500 activating outlets, an increase of 20%.

## Win with data

Continued to expand our 4G network and launched 5G in several OpCos to enhance customer experience for mobile users and broadband enterprise users. Expanding our 4G network and improving user experience has helped drive increased smartphone penetration, customer ARPU and consumption per data user across the segment.

## Win with mobile money

Focused on growing our ecosystem and driving customer acquisition. We launched new international money transfer routes, as well as new loan products and continued to integrate more partners into our ecosystem.

## Win with cost

Continued to enhance cost efficiency through changes in operating design and our response to macroeconomic changes. Examples are the rollout of most new sites using green initiatives like solar, batteries and grid connection.

Embraced robust cost discipline and worked to find new ways to reduce operating costs by using the technology to optimise our networks and improve our capital expenditure efficiency.

Reviewed and approved our second Sustainability Report.

Focused on a fair net zero transition with the adoption of our scope 3 plan.

The Board continued to commit to developing infrastructure and services to drive both digital and financial inclusion for people across Africa.

Reviewed and committed to our five-year pan-African partnership with UNICEF to roll out digital learning through connecting schools and ensuring free access to learning platforms in 13 countries.

Reviewed the Board, committee and senior management succession plans as presented by the Group chair on behalf of the Nominations Committee.

At each Board meeting, heard committee chair updates on the work of each committee and discussed and endorsed committees' work as necessary.

Considered ESG and health and safety updates as part of the Board and Sustainability Committee updates.

Reviewed the full year results for sustainability KPIs and progress against targets - and set goals and targets for forthcoming year.

## Financial/performance

Approved the full year results and financial statements, as well as the Annual Report and financial statements and accompanying RNS announcements for the 2023 financial year.

Approved the half year results statement and quarterly statements for the 2024 financial year and accompanying RNS announcements.

Reviewed company share performance and shareholder/analyst feedback.

Discussed and approved our budget and annual operating plan for 2023/24 and received updates on execution.

Reviewed and approved our tax and treasury policies (see www.airtel.africa ).

Reviewed investor relations, external communications and media updates at each scheduled Board meeting, and reviewed and discussed a market and investor update from our corporate brokers.

Approved payment of the interim dividend for the financial half year 2023/24 and recommended a final dividend for the financial year 2023.

Continued to focus on strengthening our balance sheet.

Approved the annual operating plan for the year ended 31 March 2024.

Regularly reviewed our financial performance and forecasts.

Endorsed our strategy of reducing external foreign currency debt at Group level.

Determined a conservative leverage profile with a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.4x as of March 2024 in line with our continued focus on a strong balance sheet.

Agreed to commit to:

-  A $125m revolving credit facility to provide potential interest rate savings in exchange for achieving social impact milestones. These relate to digital inclusion and gender balance with a focus on rural areas and women and align with our sustainability strategy
-  A $194m facility with International Finance Corporation (IFC), a sister organisation of the World Bank and a member of the World Bank Group. We're committed to complying with the IFC Performance Standards on social and environmental sustainability and have put in place an environmental and social action plan.

This is in line with our strategy to raise local currency and US dollar debt in our local OpCos. These facilities underpin our commitment to transforming lives across the communities where we operate, including addressing inequality and supporting economic growth.

## Foreign exchange (FX) headwinds and currency devaluations

Considered currency devaluation sensitivity risk going forward and how operating leverage and cost efficiencies could offset exchange rate headwinds and inflationary pressures (Kenyan shilling, Malawi kwacha, Nigerian naira, Zambian kwacha.)

## Nigerian naira devaluation

Considered in detail the changes in the FX market in Nigeria introduced by the Central Bank. These had a significant impact during the year on our reported currency revenue growth, although this should not overshadow our strong overall growth. These changes will support our businesses longer term in Nigeria, where we continue to invest, and the Board remains focused on enhancing long-term value through sustained and efficient growth.

Considered the accounting treatment of the naira devaluation and whether should be classified as exceptional.

For more on our response to Nigerian naira devaluation, see page 50 Similar considerations were given to the Malawian kwacha devaluation.

## FX scarcity issues

Following the devaluation of the Nigerian naira and Malawi kwacha, we tracked whether the new foreign currency policy and subsequent realignment of the several market exchange rates would provide greater US dollar liquidity over time and help to alleviate the challenges of the last few years in accessing US dollars in the market.

Reviewed the legal, regulatory and commercial aspects of potential structures for FX sourcing and repatriation of funds.

Deloitte presented the audit plan and we considered whether this would drive further improvement in audit quality.

Agreed the viability statement disclosed in the 2023 Annual Report.

Reviewed risk reports, the appropriateness of preparing financial statements on the going concern basis and the Audit and Risk Committee's advice on making a 'fair, balanced and understandable' statement in the Annual Report.

Approved the adoption of the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the half and full year results.

## Corporate governance continued

## Win with people

Regularly reviewed our strategy to ensure that we always have the right people, with the right skills in the right roles at the right cost, who can demonstrate Airtel Africa's unique culture. This year we focused particularly on Airtel Money, Business to Business (Enterprise business, Nxtra (data centre) and Fiberco) and OpCo network operations.

Supported the growth of young talent through graduate training programmes.

Heard regular updates from our chief HR officer on talent considerations including trends in recruitment, staff retention and turnover, and succession planning.

Established a regulatory sub-committee of the Board, chaired by Paul Arkwright, special adviser to the chair and Board. This will: ensure oversight of geopolitical trends and opportunities to maximise influence on political and security developments in our OpCos. It will also:

-  Create a results-focused forum to address regulatory and market access issues
-  Consider political, legal and reputational risk in the medium term (including government and policy changes affecting business operations)
-  Factor in relevant events such as Board meetings, strategy discussions and visits by our chair to OpCos (including in his capacity as chair of the G20 B2B Group on integration of African economies).

This committee does not seek to interfere with the work of the regulatory team or regional MDs.

Held two additional single topic Board meetings to review:

1.    Our Annual Report to ensure it was fair, balanced and understandable before formal approval at the May Board meeting
2.    Our second Sustainability Report to make sure it was aligned with our 10-year business plan

Our corporate legal advisors, Herbert Smith Freehills LLP, provided training on the political environment, governance reform, liability to investors and the focus on directors' duties. The subsequent Board discussion focused on audit, diversity, market abuse and section 172 compliance.

## Our roadmap to net zero and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions

In November 2023, we launched our scope 3 strategy. This focuses on an ongoing engagement programme across our supply chain with top-tier partners and suppliers, ensures a regular flow of information, and enables us to monitor their impact on the environment.

Continued to monitor scope 1 and 2 emissions with the intention to achieve our near-term target of 62% reduction in scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity by 2032.

Our strategy has been costed and is being rolled out to the business.

## Our Board strategy session October 2023

| Purpose                        | To review external changes and understand potential impacts on our long-term strategy. And to assess both the risk and opportunities we face and identify key topics to consider continuing maximising both shareholder and stakeholder value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Attendees                      | 40 people, including our: • Board • Group Executive Committee (ExCo) • Group strategy team • Finance team                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Reviewing the external context | Our Board discussion was in the context of a challenging operating environment and unprecedented market volatility driven by macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, including inflationary pressures, political uncertainty and FX devaluation across several key markets. In this context, we considered the short-, medium- and long-term impact on our portfolio, supply chain and stakeholders, and the consequences for our transition to net zero by 2050. This was set against positive economic prospects in sub-Saharan Africa: a growing youthful population, rising urbanisation and low unique SIM penetration. For now, persistent inflationary pressures continue to subdue economic prospects. |
| Confirming strategic options   | Our 'Win with' strategy continues to help us create value for our shareholders. Westress- tested the strategy and its alignment with our purpose by assessing the following areas: • The progress made by each OpCo against Group targets, as well as processes supporting growth and potential opportunities • Our financial strategy, including the balance of capital allocation and our approach to funding accelerated growth • Investor priorities and views on our strategy and ambitions • The role of our people and our organisational culture, skills and capabilities • The optimal business mix to support net zero and deliver long-term value                                                   |
| Outcomes and next steps        | Weagreed to make sure upcoming Board work includes: • Confirming that our strategic pillars are unchanged and that digitisation and sustainability continues to underpin each pillar • Confirming that each of our collaborative businesses - GSM, Airtel Money, Airtel Business and Airtel Digital - are well placed for their continued focus on growth and execution • Approving the strategic priorities for each OpCo and agreeing optimal growth areas within each • Regularly reviewing our capital allocation framework in the context of the evolving macroeconomic environment • Setting an ongoing programme of strategic questions and topics to consider during 2023/24                           |

## Board attendance

Our directors make every effort to attend all Board and committee meetings. During this reporting period, our Board and committee meetings were fully attended with one exception. In October 2023, Sunil Bharti Mittal was called to a last-minute meeting with India's prime minister, Narendra Modi, and so was unable to attend the scheduled Board meeting. He passed on his comments through Akhil Gupta and Andy Green, senior independent director.

If a director is unable to attend a meeting, they receive the papers in advance and give their comments to the chair to communicate at the meeting. The chair follows up with them after the meeting about decisions taken.

Directors' other significant commitments are disclosed to the Board during their appointment, and they must notify the Board of any subsequent changes. We have reviewed the availability of the chair and the non-executive directors to perform their duties and consider that each of them can and does devote the necessary amount of time to Airtel Africa.

## A closer look at…

## Governing the separation of Airtel Money

## Keeping a close eye on progress

During the year, our Board closely monitored the progress made on restructuring the Airtel Money Commerce B.V. (AMC BV).

The Airtel Money CEO gave quarterly presentations and reports to our Board. These covered areas such as quarterly performance, financial data, risks and opportunities, and significant issues. He also reported monthly to the Board on significant developments, including the status of the restructuring project across our mobile money business and progress against completion conditions as described in the investment agreement.

## Key interests and concerns

## IT and cybersecurity strategies

Through the Audit and Risk Committee, the Board monitored the rollout of the IT strategy to ensure platform stability and service uptime for customers.

Our aim was to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the money transfer business. We needed to consider the strict controls exerted by each of the 13 connected central banks and the financial intelligence departments in each market. So, the Board requested that management intervene on a timely basis to minimise incidents and frauds. To this end, our Audit and Risk Committee received regular updates on IT and cybersecurity strategies, particularly around the Mobiquity platform upgrade and IT process refinements.

## Controls, risks and compliance

Our Board asked Andy Green, as a member of our Audit and Risk Committee, to attend AMC BV Audit and Risk Committee meetings. The committee benefited from his knowledge, expertise and guidance, and his quarterly reports to the Board provided oversight and assurance on how the committee was monitoring controls and risk-related issues. Our aim was to make sure that all controls on potential significant anti-money laundering breach, fraud or financial impropriety, or cybersecurity incidents were appropriately applied to minimise risks to the Group.

Every six months, our Audit and Risk Committee chair also met with the AMC BV Audit and Risk Committee chair and the AMC BV CEO to discuss strategic matters.

## A one-off remuneration vehicle to successfully deliver the AMC BV IPO

In line with the IPO journey of AMC BV, our Board approved a one-off Airtel Money pre-IPO long-term incentive plan (LTIP). This was intended to motivate, reward and retain key employees, incentivising exceptional business performance.

## Corporate governance continued

## Board evaluation

## Board performance

With the assistance of the company secretary, we evaluated the effectiveness of our Board and its committees and directors in the last quarter of the financial year. Our aim was to measure our Board operations against good practice and the corporate governance principles referred to in Principle L and Provisions 21, 22 and 23 of the Code.

In 2023/24 the Board evaluation focused on seven core areas:

-  Board composition and dynamics
-  Stakeholder oversight
-  Board support
-  Management and focus of meetings
-  Board committees
-  Strategic oversight
-  Succession planning and people oversight

During the year the Board undertook a second internal evaluation (the three previous yearly reviews were externally facilitated). The Group company secretary circulated questionnaires for feedback on a range of areas to the Board, the directors and each committee. The evaluation probed the Board's oversight of wider strategy, risk management and internal controls, succession planning and employees, and priorities for change.

A report was prepared on the completed questionnaires and the secretary relayed the feedback gathered to the chair and senior independent director. The Board and each committee then discussed the results in detail, and the chair had follow-up discussions with directors on the findings. Separately, the senior independent director held a meeting of the non-executive directors without the chair to consider the chair's performance and the running of the Board. This evaluation confirmed that the Board, its committees, and individual members all continue to operate effectively and that each performed strongly during the year.

In response to the areas identified for focus in last year's evaluation, the Board recognised that discussions and interactions between management and Board members had become more productive thanks to more time for informal engagement around formal meetings. While the IT function, cybersecurity and disaster recovery plans had improved during the year, the Board sought a deeper understanding of digital and data developments and the threats and opportunities each presented. The Board also noted that more time and resources had been allocated to strategic matters, emerging trends and potential medium- to long-term implications leading to a more meaningful Board strategy session.

While the Board's focus on risk during the year resulted in improved ratings for its oversight of risk, more work is required to mitigate risk. At the Audit and Risk Committee level, oversight of compliance controls is good - the Board would like to receive more detail on this in its own meetings.

From the anonymised survey responses, we identified key focus areas and recommendations for the Board and its committees.

## 2023/24 evaluation results

The chair and company secretary presented the reports to the Board in May 2024 for discussion and review.

Recognising its strengths and areas to develop, the Board and its principal committees agreed actions for the coming year. For details, see table 'Board evaluation 2023/24'.

## Conclusions

The 2023/24 evaluation has shown that the Board has the appropriate balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge to perform Board and committee responsibilities effectively. Respondents unanimously agreed that the Board had performed well over the year and was operating effectively.

The chair, assisted by the company secretary, drew up a list of action points based on the evaluation and allocated responsibility for completing the actions. The Board and each committee will review progress against these at each meeting.

## Reappointing directors at the AGM

In line with the Code, all directors, with the exception of John Danilovich, will be putting themselves forward for re-election at our AGM on 3 July 2024. Sunil Taldar and Paul Arkwright will stand for election following their appointments on 1 July and 9 May, respectively. Following the formal performance evaluation described here and considering each director's skills and experience (set out on pages 88-91), the Board concluded that all directors continue to give sufficient time to their Board duties and believes that the re-election of all directors is in the best interests of Airtel Africa.

The chair confirmed that the non-executive directors standing for re-election at this year's AGM continue to perform effectively, both individually and collectively. He also agreed that each non-executive director shows commitment to their roles and continues to provide constructive challenge, strategic guidance and specialist advice, including holding management to account.

## Our compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code

<!-- image -->

Airtel Africa plc ordinary shares have been trading on the main market of the London Stock Exchange since 3 July 2019, so we apply the principles and comply with the provisions of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code) and explain any noncompliance. (See the Code at frc.org.uk.) While we have a secondary listing on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NGX), we're permitted by NGX listings requirements to follow the corporate governance practices of our primary listing market.

The principles set out in the Code emphasise the value of good corporate governance to the long-term sustainable success of listed companies. Our Board is responsible for ensuring that we have appropriate frameworks in place to comply with the Code's requirements. This governance report and the strategic report set out how Airtel Africa has applied the principles of Code throughout the year.

The Board believes that during the reporting period the company was in full compliance with all applicable principles and provisions of the Code except for Provision 9, as described last year and set out below.

Teamwork is the essence of good governance and achieving solid corporate governance and transparency in our reporting remains a shared ambition at Airtel Africa.

Simon O'Hara

Group company secretary

## Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code

## Code provision not yet met

Provision 9: the chair should be independent on appointment when assessed against the circumstances set out in Provision 10.

## Explanation

The Board has concluded that our chair, Sunil Bharti Mittal, did not meet the independence criteria of the Code due to his interests in the company. However, in view of his extensive involvement with the company and the Bharti Airtel Group over many years, the Board considers that he has made a major contribution to our growth and success and unanimously agrees that his continued involvement is crucial to the ongoing success of Airtel Africa.

The Board has put several safeguards in place to ensure robust corporate governance during his tenure as chair. These include appointing Andy Green as senior independent director to act as a sounding board and support for the chair and as an intermediary for other directors and shareholders. The independent non-executive directors have carefully considered Sunil's leadership position. As part of the annual Board evaluation process, they looked at the checks and balances in place to mitigate the risk of having a nonindependent chair, including the impact on Board effectiveness and Board dynamics. They concluded that these checks and balances are strong and effective.

Our strong culture has benefited from stable and consistent leadership at Airtel Africa. The seven independent non-executive directors on the Board provide a fresh perspective and challenge, a range of corporate experience, and effective challenge to the chair and other executive directors. This was endorsed by the three consecutive external evaluation exercises undertaken since listing. The Audit and Risk Committee and the Remuneration Committee are each chaired by an independent non-executive director. The Nominations Committee is chaired by Sunil Bharti Mittal.

We also review the chair's performance as part of the annual Board evaluation exercise. In line with the Code, the chair only sits on the Nominations Committee.

The Board believes Sunil Bharti Mittal continues to effectively oversee our leadership and maintain a balanced shareholder agenda.

We'll continue to report against this provision while Bharti Airtel remains a majority shareholder or until the chair is no longer in place, at which time these arrangements will be reviewed.

## 1. Board leadership and company purpose

## A. An effective and entrepreneurial Board

Our Board is responsible for Airtel Africa's system of corporate governance. As such, directors are committed to developing and maintaining high standards of governance that reflect evolving good practice.

The Board provides strategic and entrepreneurial leadership within a framework of strong governance, effective controls and an open and transparent culture. This enables opportunities and risks to be assessed and managed appropriately. Our Board also sets our strategic aims and risk appetite, makes sure we have the financial and human resources in place to meet our objectives, and monitors our compliance and performance against our targets. And finally, the Board ensures we engage effectively with all our stakeholders and considers their views in setting our strategic priorities.

## Roles and responsibilities

We have well-documented roles and responsibilities for directors, and a clear division of key responsibilities between our chair and CEO to help maintain a strong governance framework and the effectiveness of our Board. Our clearly defined policies, processes and procedures govern all areas of the business. These will continue to be reviewed and refined to meet business requirements and changing market circumstances.

We re-examine budgets considering business forecasts throughout the year to make sure they're robust enough to reflect the possible impact of changing economic conditions and circumstances. We conduct regular reviews of actual results and future projections compared with the budget and prior-year results, as well as with various treasury reports. We monitor any disputes that could lead to significant litigation or contractual claims at each Board meeting, with updates provided by the CEO and CFO as part of their reports or tabled by the company secretary.

We have a Board-approved framework of delegated authority to identify and monitor individual responsibilities of senior executives.

The Board recognises that, as Airtel Africa continues to grow as a transformative force for good, it is our duty to uphold the highest standards of ethical conduct, integrity, and compliance in all that we do. The Board recognises that each one of us has a responsibility to adhere to all compliance policies, including the Code of Conduct and anti-bribery and corruption policy. These policies set expectations for the behaviour of all employees and are grounded in our core values of Alive, Inclusive and Respectful.

## B. Purpose, vision, strategy and culture

Our purpose is to transform the lives of people across subSaharan Africa.

Airtel Africa is transforming lives across Africa. Our services are connecting the unconnected, reaching the financially excluded and bridging the digital divide - which helps unlock the extraordinary potential for Africa's people, businesses and economies to grow. As an African business, serving the communities in which Airtel Africa people live and work, the company is a partner in delivering sustainable development objectives in the 14 countries in which we operate.

## Strategy

We're able to deliver this positive social impact because of the strength of our business model and our excellence in executing our 'Win with' strategy, which is underpinned by our four-pillar sustainability strategy.

Our products, services and programmes foster financial inclusion, drive digitisation and empower our 152 million customers and the communities in which they live. To continue to serve our vision of enriching the lives of our customers, we have a clear business objective: to grow market share profitably and create superior enterprise value while delivering our sustainability strategy.

We provide essential services that are unlocking the potential for people and economies to grow. The Board sets the strategy for aligning with our purpose. Our 'Win with' strategy ensures that working to deliver our sustainability strategy underpins everything we do. Our focus on the digitalisation of our products and services, as well as our internal systems and processes, increasingly functions as an accelerator for each of our strategic pillars.

Underpinning our strategy for growth is our sustainability strategy. This supports our well-established corporate purpose of transforming lives, as well as our continued commitment to sustainable development and acting as a responsible business. Our sustainability strategy sets out our goals and commitments to foster financial inclusion, bridge the digital divide and serve more customers in some of the least penetrated telecoms markets in the world. This year, we continued to make strong progress in each of our core strategic pillars: 'Win with technology', 'Win with distribution', 'Win with data', 'Win with mobile money', 'Win with cost' and 'Win with people'.

- For more on our strategy, see the strategic report from pages 24-33

## Culture

Our Board believes that a healthy culture - which drives the right behaviours, protects and generates value and helps employees live up to our values - will lead to the successful delivery of our business goals. It is responsible for defining our values and setting clear standards from the top. Our chair leads the way by ensuring our Board operates correctly and with a clear culture of its own which can be cascaded to our wider operations and dealings with all stakeholders. Our CEO, with the help of the CFO, our chief HR Officer and the senior leadership team, is responsible for the culture within our wider operations.

To enable us to build a high-performing workforce that aligns with our business priorities, our talent strategy mirrors the four pillars of our people strategy: talent acquisition, talent development, diversity and performance management. We continue to build our people and talent capabilities and our business capacity through:

-  On-the-job learning and encouraging teams to take ownership of their development, supported by the 70:20:10 development principle - experience, exposure and education
-  Simplifying and automating HR and employee processes, removing duplication of work and embedding cross-functional collaboration

## Our compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code continued

-  Improving rewards and recognition for employee performance including fixed, variable and share incentive plans
-  Embedding our pay for performance principles which guides our reward philosophy and how we review our employee performance

Our chief internal auditor has a robust reporting framework for monitoring our compliance culture and includes findings in the quarterly internal audit report to the Audit and Risk Committee for subsequent sharing with the Board.

The Board receives regular reports that allow it to examine our company culture. This has led to Board discussions on topics ranging from gender balance across the business to how to achieve better workforce engagement. The Board strives to satisfy itself that policies, practices and behaviours throughout the business are in line with our purpose, vision, values and strategy.

In 2024, the directors revised our Board Diversity policy to include support for the recommendations and targets set out in the FTSE Women Leaders Review (formerly Hampton-Alexander Review) on gender balance, the Parker Review on ethnic diversity, and more generally the Listing Rules. Our Nominations Committee considered the Board's diversity as part of director recruitment exercises and monitors progress against our gender balance targets.

- For more information on Board diversity, see page 144

At each meeting, the Board was updated through the CEO's quarterly report on issues affecting the health and wellbeing of employees. This resulted in several employee wellness initiatives, as well as support for emergency responses during natural disasters. A key component of our sustainability strategy is ensuring we create a safe working environment for all employees.

- For more information on employee wellbeing, see page 116

Our Remuneration Committee helps the Board oversee culture by making sure our remuneration philosophy and principles encourage behaviours consistent with our purpose, vision, values, strategy and culture. It does this primarily by focusing on diversity and inclusion, people and community engagement. The committee tracks performance in these areas and reports to the Board as appropriate.

Annika Poutiainen is our Board sustainability champion, supported by the CEO, CFO and company secretary as fellow committee members. She reports at each Board meeting on the work of the Sustainability Committee. This meets every two months and receives occupational health and safety updates enabling directors to monitor key metrics of our health and safety framework.

Our chief HR officer attends most Board meetings and all Remuneration Committee meetings to update members on diversity and inclusion efforts, how we attract and retain talent, succession planning and employee engagement. The chair of the Remuneration Committee also includes these topics in his report to the Board.

While our leadership establishes our culture and leads by example, our clear policies and Code of Conduct ensure that our obligations to shareholders and other stakeholders are clearly understood and met, as described in more detail on pages 114-125.

- For more on how our Board oversees our culture, see page 116

Our risk management framework supports informed risk-taking by our businesses, setting out the risks that we're prepared to be exposed to and the risks that we want to avoid.

More information on risk management can be found on pages 70-77

## D. Stakeholder engagement

Our Board members are increasingly engaging with shareholders and wider stakeholders and addressing their concerns. This is in keeping with our sustainability strategy, which addresses stakeholder concerns as advised by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), and the ongoing development of our remuneration policy. Our director induction includes directors' duties under section 172 of the Companies Act 2006.

The Board regularly receives feedback on shareholder sentiment and sell-side analysts' views of our business and the wider industry. Our Investor Relations team and management have frequent contact with the 14 active equity research analysts who follow Airtel Africa.

The chair of the Board, the Remuneration Committee chair, other members of the Group's senior management such as the company secretary and head of sustainability, as appropriate, also engage regularly with investors on a wide range of matters including governance, people, remuneration and sustainability.

Our Board discusses the impact of all major decisions on our workforce before drawing its conclusion. Sunil Bharti Mittal is our designated Board director for employee engagement, given his regular travel to our OpCos.

Stakeholder considerations are included in every Board paper as part of the standard template. This ensures that we factor the needs and concerns of our stakeholders into Board discussions and decisions in line with section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 (see statement on page 71).

For more on how we engage with our key stakeholders see pages 114-125

## E. Workforce policies and practices

We expect all businesses and employees to work with the highest standards of integrity and conduct at all times. Our updated Code of Conduct, which can be found on our website, sets out our expectations in detail. We also have policies focused on anti-bribery and corruption, whistleblowing and data protection (GDPR) setting out the framework that all companies and employees are expected to follow. Each year, our employees receive up-to-date training on legislative and regulatory matters.

Our management processes and divisions of responsibility are detailed in the following documents, which can be seen on our website:

-  Schedule of matters reserved for Board decisions, including profit expectations and dividend policy
-  Terms of reference for Audit and Risk, Nominations, Sustainability and Remuneration Committees
-  Policies covering operational, compliance, corporate responsibility and stakeholder matters, including ones related to the Bribery Act 2010 and anti-corruption - these are updated as necessary in line with developments in corporate governance and legislation
-  Our Articles of Association

Our policies are reported on to the Board and Audit and Risk Committee by our chief of internal audit and risk assurance, chief compliance officer and Group company secretary.

- A description of our whistleblowing procedures is set out on page 135

## Our compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code continued

To help people develop fulfilling and rewarding careers, we have a performance and reward system. We look to promote internally and to give people roles where they can grow their skills and capabilities. Our Airtel Africa mobility programme helps us identify and reward high-performing teams by sending them to different OpCos to share and enhance skills.

We continue to identify training needs through manager assessments and employee input. We also use performance review feedback to make sure people can develop the skills they need. Our learning and development provision includes our online learning platform, Percipio, in-person training, and cross-border and cross-functional training.

All employees are given help, training and encouragement to reach their potential and use their unique talents. Our efforts are strategically focused on enhancing functional capabilities and fostering leadership qualities.

We continually work on cybersecurity awareness through ongoing employee training ensuring that necessary responses to cybersecurity risks are clearly understood. We run regular training programmes on cybersecurity and conduct regular cybersecurity risk assessments to increase awareness of social engineering fraud and system access caused by poor security protocols.

- For more detail on our learning and development initiatives, see page 117 of this report and our 2024 Sustainability Report

## 2. Division of responsibilities

## F. Role of the chair

The roles and responsibilities of the chair and CEO have been clearly defined, set out in writing and signed by Sunil Bharti Mittal and Segun Ogunsanya.

The chair leads our Board and is responsible for its overall effectiveness in directing the company, its governance and balanced decision-making. He ensures that we think long term when making decisions - and that sustainability, including but not limited to climate change, is considered at the levels of strategy, operations and risk. He also engages with major shareholders and key stakeholders to make sure our Board understands and considers their views. He sets the cultural tone of the businesses and leads initiatives to assess culture.

Our chair and the senior independent director hold separate meetings at least once a year with non-executive directors without the CEO present. Each did this once during the 2023/24 reporting period. Led by the senior independent director, the non-executive directors also meet at least once during the year without the chair to appraise his performance. On separate occasions, the chair and the senior independent director also meet formally with independent nonexecutive directors without executive directors or other non-executive directors present. Through these meetings, the chair and senior independent director make sure we maintain a fair and open culture where all Board members can make a strong contribution.

The Board is aware that Sunil Bharti Mittal did not meet the independence criteria of the Code when he was appointed due to his interests in the company. Considering his extensive involvement with the Bharti Airtel Group over many years and his major contribution to Airtel Africa's growth, the Board unanimously agrees that his continued involvement is crucially important to our ongoing success. We have several safeguards in place to ensure robust corporate governance during his tenure as chair, including Andy Green in position as a strong senior independent director.

The Board believes Sunil Bharti Mittal continues to effectively oversee our leadership and maintain a balanced shareholder agenda.

## G. Board composition and division of responsibilities

Our Board consists of 11 directors: non-executive chair Sunil Bharti Mittal, who is not independent, CEO Segun Ogunsanya, CFO Jaideep Paul, six independent non-executive directors and two non-executive directors. Andy Green, CBE, is the senior independent director and Simon O'Hara is our Group company secretary.

The Board has an established framework of delegated financial, commercial and operational authorities that define the scope and powers of the CEO and of operational management.

- For more on our Board and executive roles, see page 95

## H. Role of non-executive directors

Our independent non-executive directors offer advice and guidance to the CEO and CFO, drawing on their wide experience in business and diverse backgrounds. They also provide constructive challenge and hold management to account - monitoring the overall direction and strategy of the company, scrutinising the performance of the CEO and CFO, and ensuring the integrity of the financial information made available to the Board and our shareholders. They play an important part in general succession planning for the Board and other executive and senior management positions.

The senior independent director and the independent directors also play a critical role in fulfilling the requirements of the separation governance framework and ensuring Airtel Africa's independence.

The senior independent director provides a sounding board for the chair, leads the chair's annual performance evaluation and serves as an intermediary to other directors when necessary. He is available to all stakeholders if they have any concerns.

The independent non-executive directors help develop strategy, review management performance and provide independent insight and support based on their experience. They also review financial information and make sure our system of internal control and risk management is effective. They review succession plans for the Board and senior leadership, set executive remuneration policy and engage with key stakeholders and report to the Board on perspectives. Each serves on or chairs various Board committees.

## I. Board processes and role of company secretary

Our company secretary supports the chair, ensuring the Board has high-quality information, adequate time and appropriate resources. He also advises the Board on corporate governance and facilitates professional development for Board members.

We have a range of processes in place to make sure our Board is fully informed in a timely manner to be able to perform its duties. Directors receive papers before each Board and committee meeting through a secure online portal. This allows them to prepare for meetings and to send in their views if unable to attend.

The CEO and the CFO send updates to directors on important issues between meetings. Directors also receive a monthly report on key financial and management information, as well as regular updates on shareholder issues and analysts' notes.

All directors have direct access to the advice and services of the Group company secretary. And non-executive directors can take independent legal advice at the Company's expense when necessary to fulfil their duties to the company.

We take time at the end of each Board meeting to review our Board and committee processes and to build on actions introduced because of the annual evaluation exercise. Coordinated by the company secretary and led by the chair, we consider feedback from Board members to improve our efficiency.

## 3. Composition, succession and evaluation

## J. Board appointments

As part of our 2023/24 Board evaluation, we reaffirmed that each of our independent non-executive directors is independent in character and that there are no relationships that could affect their judgement.

The main objective of our Nominations Committee is to make sure we have the best possible leadership team by overseeing a formal, rigorous and transparent process for appointing and removing directors to or from the Board, our committees and other senior roles. The committee also works to improve diversity and develop our succession-planning processes.

- For details on our Nominations Committee's activities and processes during the year, including changes to our Board and directors, see pages 138-148

## K. Skills, experience and knowledge of the Board and its committees

We have an engaged and diverse Board who reflect the cultural and ethnic diversity of the countries in which we operate. Our Board members bring a range of practical experience and deep expertise to our business - and at least half of our directors, excluding the chair, are independent non-executive directors, in line with the Code's recommendations.

The Board considers that each director brings relevant and complementary skills, experience and background to the Board, details of which are set out in the biographies on pages 88-91 and the skills matrix on page 87.

## L. Board evaluation

As part of good governance, it's important to make sure our Board as a whole, its committees and each director is operating and performing effectively. The Code requires an externally facilitated evaluation at least every three years. We chose to conduct our first three evaluations this way to enable us to plan effectively for the future.

- See pages 106-107 for details

## 4. Audit, risk and internal control

## M. Independence and effectiveness of internal and external audit

Each year, our Audit and Risk Committee identifies the key risks to be reviewed and assessed by Internal Audit as part of its programme of work to enhance our control environment. It makes sure that our policies and procedures safeguard the independence and effectiveness of internal and external audit functions and that our financial and narrative statements are true and complete.

During 2023/24, Deloitte UK performed an external statutory audit of year ended 31 March 2024, as well as a half-yearly review. See page 136 for a discussion of its independence and effectiveness.

- For more on the activities and processes of our Audit and Risk Committee, see page 126-137

## N. Fair, balanced and understandable assessment

Pages 15-47 of the strategic report set out our performance, business model and strategy, as well as the risks and uncertainties relating to the company's future prospects. When taken as a whole, the directors consider this Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable and provides information necessary for shareholders to assess our performance, business model and strategy.

- For more on the Audit and Risk Committee's assessment of fair, balanced and reasonable see page 132

## O. Risk management, internal control and determining principal risks

As highlighted in the strategy and risk sections of the strategic report, managing risk is inherent to our management thinking and business planning processes. The Board has overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining our risk management and internal control systems. Our Audit and Risk Committee supports the Board in reviewing the effectiveness of our internal controls, including financial, operational and compliance, and risk management systems.

- For more on the activities and processes of this committee, see pages 126-137

## 5. Remuneration

## P. Remuneration policies and practices

Our remuneration policy is intended to attract, motivate and retain high-calibre directors, to promote the long-term success of Airtel Africa, and to be in line with best practice and the interests of our stakeholders. It's designed to be appropriate for a listed company in the UK while taking account of our very specific circumstances: being listed on the LSE with a secondary listing on the Nigerian Stock Exchange and operating in 14 countries in Africa.

There are two key principles of our remuneration policy. One, that remuneration packages and performance-based schemes should be aligned with stakeholders' interests and support our business strategy and objectives. And two, that the performance-based remuneration element should be appropriately balanced between the achievement of short-term objectives and longer-term objectives.

In 2023, changes were made to the remuneration policy and reported in the 2023 directors' remuneration report.

## Provision 41 engagement with the workforce

During this financial year, we engaged with employees on a number of issues, including remuneration, in a variety of ways - and in doing so remain compliant with Provision 41 of the Code.

- See page 115-119 for details

## Q. Procedure for developing remuneration policy

The Remuneration Committee regularly reviews our policy to ensure that it operates as intended, is in line with best practice and is aligned with our evolving business strategy.

## R. Exercising independent judgement

In the year ended 31 March 2024, Alvarez &amp; Marsal provided remuneration advice and benchmarking data, and Clifford Chance provided legal advice in relation to share plan matters and remuneration advice to our Remuneration Committee.

The committee uses its discretion, within the maximum policy limits, to consider the target bonus taking account of market development opportunities, specific events and evolving roles. While the committee has the discretion to change the metrics and weighting for the bonus plan from year to year, we normally consult with major shareholders before making any significant changes.

See our remuneration report on pages 146-165 for details

## Engaging with our stakeholders

## Our section 172 statement

This section explains how the Board engaged with stakeholders' interests and concerns and considered them when making business decisions in 2023/24 - in relation to their duties under section 172 (a) to (f) of the Companies Act 2006.

We aim to consistently apply our purpose, vision and core values particularly 'respectful' - when making decisions and delivering our strategy. This helps us meaningfully engage with all our stakeholders, regardless of the outcome of any particular decision.

Directors are kept informed about our stakeholders' views in a number of ways, including through their own direct interactions. Stakeholder engagement takes place at both Group and local operational level.

During the year, the Board and its committees considered information from across Airtel Africa and received presentations from management. Every Board paper now includes stakeholder interests relevant to the decisions being considered. Directors regularly visit our local operations, and we hold Board meetings at regional offices to hear from representatives of the local business.

These measures enabled the Board to consider the likely consequences of decisions over the long term and potential impacts on stakeholders.

We know our stakeholders will hold a range of views about the decisions we take - and that not everything we do will please everyone, all the time.

## How we work to understand our stakeholders

Identifying our key stakeholders and their interests, needs and level of influence is fundamental to successfully engaging with them. Our approach to identifying stakeholders is led by the AA1000 Stakeholder Engagement Standard, developed by AccountAbility, a guiding framework for businesses to effectively interact with their stakeholders. This defines key stakeholders as 'individuals, groups of individuals or organisations that affect and/or could be affected by an organisation's activities, products or services and associated performance with regard to the issues to be addressed by the engagement'.

We recognise stakeholders who we have the most significant impact on and who have the most material influence on our activities. This year we added media and non-profit or non-governmental organisations (NGOs) as new stakeholder groups. The priority stakeholders as identified in our matrix are:

Our chair is committed to ensuring that the Board hears both positive and negative stakeholder views and is supported in this by the executive team. The chair, the chairs of each committee, the senior independent director, CEO, CFO and our company secretary are all available to address concerns raised by stakeholders.

All engagements with stakeholders by anyone at Airtel Africa are underpinned by our set of business standards, which have stakeholder interests at their core. Our Code of Conduct sets out our high expectations for how all of us should behave, including respect for human rights and data privacy, and always acting lawfully. It helps support our belief that the value we create as a business must ultimately be shared between all stakeholders and contribute towards renewing and reaffirming the trust they have in us - and that we have in them.

## Our customers

As of 31 March 2024, 152.7 million customers across Africa use our data, voice and mobile money services to connect, live and work.

## How we engaged during the year

We do our best to engage with our customers using their preferred channel and have made significant inroads into giving people convenient options for interacting with us. Our key interaction points are digital: MyAirtel app, unstructured supplementary services data (USSD), our contact centre, automated phone services (IVR), email and social media.

Customers are also able to receive our services through 782 retail outlets, where we talk to them about the products and services that matter to them. Key services at retail outlets include Airtel Money cash and float services, SIM swap, home broadband sales, post-paid collections and distribution support.

Capturing our customers' views through these many channels informs our customer experience strategy. Using quantitative feedback such as interaction data and by analysing volume trends, we can identify which channels customers prefer to access different services.

For qualitative feedback, we ask customers visiting contact centres or company-owned retail stores to complete a net promoter score (NPS) survey. This gives us an NPS score that helps us measure customer loyalty, satisfaction and enthusiasm for Airtel Africa. The score also enables us to narrow down issues to process, store, or agent gaps. Our score rose from 15 at the beginning of the year to 29 on 31 March 2024.

We also use customer satisfaction surveys when developing new products and services.

## Board oversight

Our Board is kept informed of customer-focused matters through CEO and CFO reports, which give an overview of operations by region, country and sector level. Executive directors are supported by their senior leadership and marketing teams who provide deeper analysis of the customer base. From these reports, the Board forms a view of the interests and priorities of customers and our ongoing engagement activities.

## Interests and concerns

This year, customers continued to prioritise trust, convenience and reliability. They rely on the speed, uptime and accessibility of our network to use mobile money services. They also want to make sure their data and information is secure.

Many of our customers continue to worry about increases in the cost of living. People want to get as much value for their money as possible and are concerned about being able to buy more data and making data last longer.

## Outcome and actions

We've deliberately diversified to offer customers more solutions that meet their needs. For example, our Airtel Money business now gives customers more payment options including utilities, bank-to-wallet connections and international money transfers.

We've strengthened our self-service options for customers to make sure these are simple, secure and intuitive on channels such as MyAirtel app, USSD and automated phone services. This allows people to easily access our bundle information at the point of purchase and check their balances.

And we've empowered our enterprise customers by introducing a business care portal where they can independently manage mobile services. They can now see and download statements, make payments, renew services and raise service requests at their convenience.

To provide more security for our customers, we've enhanced MyAirtel app's security features for self-PIN management to protect people from fraud. And we've moved beyond transactions and enhanced digital engagement on the MyAirtel app with Airtel TV and games to keep customers connected and entertained.

We now have 152.7 million customers and 38 million customers with Airtel Money mobile wallets. As a result of our network upgrade efforts, Airtel Money agents base grew by 53%. And customers have responded positively to our strategic initiatives, as shown by the 14-point rise in our NPS score.

## Our people

Continually ensuring Airtel Africa is a great place to work involves creating effective ways to listen to our 4,132 full-time colleagues across 18 countries.

## How we engaged during the year

We're constantly looking for ways to better communicate and engage with all our employees to understand their needs and views. We've pursued various initiatives to ensure that our colleagues feel valued, heard and motivated. Here are some key mechanisms we used during the year.

## Town halls

Our regular town halls at both at Group and OpCo level have been important in developing a sense of unity and purpose across the business.

They allow us to communicate and engage with all local teams and address collective issues. During town halls at Group and OpCo level, employees can ask questions, make suggestions and raise concerns with senior leaders.

-  Quarterly all-employee town halls at Group level allow leaders and independent non-executive directors to share business results, strategy and sustainability updates, people updates, concerns and questions on day-to-day business deliverables - feedback from these is reported to the Board
-  Quarterly town halls at OpCo level allow OpCo executive leadership to engage with all employees including sales executives and middle managers
-  The chair holds special town halls when he visits headquarters or OpCos - this year, he had town halls in Republic of the Congo, Dubai, Gabon, Kenya and Nigeria
-  Functional CEOs hold town halls with functions to share new ways of working and catch up with teams
-  An additional all-employee town hall was held following the announcement of the change of CEO, to introduce Sunil Taldar and provide an opportunity for Segun Ogunsanya to explain to his colleagues the reasons for his decision to retire

## One-on-one meetings

Senior Group and OpCo leaders meet directly with employees as part of our open-door policy. Managers also have one-on-one meetings with their direct reports to discuss business matters and employee concerns - these include:

-  Skip-level meetings with functional CEOs at OpCo level
-  High-potential employees connecting with business leaders
-  Exit interviews to understand reasons for leaving

## HR roadshows

We hold events to share information about benefits and policies and discuss questions from employees. These are held both in person and virtually each quarter and include HR directors and MDs in some OpCos.

## Engaging with our stakeholders continued

## Mentoring

During the year, two of our independent non-executive directors, Awuneba Ajumogobia and Annika Poutiainen, acted as mentors for 'Women for technology' programme participants. The sessions were virtual, so participants could join from across Africa and were able to share their own career journeys, tips for growth and their personal experiences in balancing career and family and navigating the work environment.

## Employee wellness initiatives

Each office has a medical provider visit for two days to carry out health checks and give advice to employees as needed. This is a mix of virtual and in person - for example, cancer awareness sessions are virtual while wellness check-ups are carried out in person.
