## 10. Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC's website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.

## 11. Extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.

## 11.1 Identifying and assessing potential risks related toÂ irregularities

In identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations, we considered the following:

-  the nature of the industry and sector, control environment and business performance including the design of the group's remuneration policies, key drivers for directors' remuneration, bonus levels and performance targets;
-  results of our enquiries of management, internal audit, the directors and the Audit and Risk Committee about their own identification and assessment of the risks of irregularities, including those that are specific to the group's sector;
-  any matters we identified having obtained and reviewed the group's documentation of their policies and procedures relating to:
-  identifying, evaluating and complying with laws and regulations and whether they were aware of any instances of non-compliance;
-  detecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud;
-  the internal controls established to mitigate risks of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations;
-  the matters discussed among the audit engagement team including significant component audit teams and relevant internal specialists, including tax, valuations and IT specialists regarding how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements and any potential indicators of fraud.

As a result of these procedures, we considered the opportunities and incentives that may exist within the organisation for fraud and identified the greatest potential for fraud in the following areas: prepaid and mobile money revenue, the existence of mobile money restricted cash and the classification of legal matters in components operating in certain jurisdiction. In common with all audits under ISAs (UK), we are also required to perform specific procedures to respond to the risk of management override.

We also obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that the group operates in, focusing on provisions of those laws and regulations that had a direct effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The key laws and regulations we considered in this context included the UK Companies Act, Listing Rules and tax legislation in the jurisdictions that the group operates.

In addition, we considered provisions of other laws and regulations that do not have a direct effect on the financial statements but compliance with which may be fundamental to the group's ability to operate or to avoid a material penalty. These included the regulations set by the telecommunication and mobile money regulator within each operating entity and the relevant financial regulations which govern the group's components.

## 11.2 Audit response to risks identified

As a result of performing the above, we identified prepaid and mobile money revenue, mobile money restricted cash and classification of legal matters as key audit matters relating to the potential risk of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations. The key audit matters section of our report explains the matters in more detail and also describes the specific procedures we performed in response to those key audit matters.

In addition to the above, our procedures to respond to risks identified included the following:

-  reviewing the financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with provisions of relevant laws and regulations described as having a direct effect on the financial statements;
-  enquiring of management, the Audit and Risk Committee and in-house legal counsel concerning actual and potential litigation and claims;
-  performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that may indicate risks of material misstatement due to fraud;
-  reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance, reviewing internal audit reports and reviewing relevant correspondence with relevant tax authorities; and
-  in addressing the risk of fraud through management override of controls, testing the appropriateness of journal entries and other adjustments; assessing whether the judgements made in making accounting estimates are indicative of a potential bias; and evaluating the business rationale of any significant transactions that are unusual or outside the normal course of business.

We also communicated relevant identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risks to all engagement team members including internal specialists and significant component audit teams and remained alert to any indications of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations throughout the audit.

## Report on other legal and regulatory requirements

## 12. Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006

In our opinion the part of the directors' remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

-  the information given in the strategic report and the directors' report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
-  the strategic report and the directors' report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified any material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors' report.
