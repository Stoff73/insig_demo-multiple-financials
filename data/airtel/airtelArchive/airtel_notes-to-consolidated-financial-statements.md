## 2. Summary of material accounting policies

## 2.1 Basis of preparation

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and approved for use in the United Kingdom (UK) by the UK Accounting Standards Endorsement Board (UKEB).

All the amounts included in the financial statements are reported in US dollars, with all values rounded to the nearest millions ($m) except when otherwise indicated. Further, amounts which are less than half a million are appearing as '0'.

The accounting policies as set out in the following paragraphs of this note have been consistently applied by all the Group's entities to all the periods presented in these consolidated financial statements. During the year, the Group has changed the classification of distribution costs relating to its mobile money business to better reflect the nature of these costs, reclassifying costs previously included in other operating expenses to the sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

New and amended standards and interpretations that are effective for the current year

No new IFRS issued during the year are applicable to the Group.

Amendments to existing IFRSs have been applied by the Group as required, however, these amendments do not have any material impact on the Group's financial statements. The list of new IFRS and newly issued amendments is as follows:

-  Amendments to IAS 12 in relation to relation to 'deferred tax related to assets and liabilities arising from a single transaction'.
-  Amendments to IAS 1 in relation to 'Disclosure of Accounting Policies', including removal of certain immaterial policies.
-  Amendments to IAS 8 in relation to 'Definition of Accounting Estimates'.
-  Amendments to IAS 12 in relation to relation to 'Pillar Two Model rules' (see below for more details).

On 25 May 2023, the amendments to IAS 12 'Income Taxes' were released by IASB and endorsed by the UKEB on 19 July 2023. These amendments relate to International Tax Reform 'Pillar 2 income taxes' and clarify how the effects of the global minimum tax framework should be accounted for and disclosed. The amendments also provide a temporary mandatory exception from deferred tax accounting for the top-up tax, which would have been effective immediately, if this exception was not provided. The Group using this exception has therefore not recognised or disclosed tax assets and liabilities relating to 'Pillar 2 income taxes'.

On 23 March 2023, HM Treasury released draft legislation for the Global Minimum Tax rules in the UK which was substantively enacted on 20 June 2023, this legislation will apply to the Group with effect from 1 April 2024.

The Group predominantly operates in jurisdictions which have a simplified effective tax rate above 15% and is expecting to rely on the Transitional Country-by-Country Reporting (CbCR) Safe Harbour provisions until 31 March 2027. During the year, a transitional safe harbour assessment was performed for all the Group's jurisdictions and material top-up tax is not expected to arise. The assessment was based on the profits and tax expense determined as part of the preparation of the Group's consolidated financial statements, considering only certain adjustments that would have been required applying the legislation.

## 2.2 Basis of measurement

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments that are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period as explained in the accounting policies below.

Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services.

Fair value measurement

Fair value is the price at the measurement date at which an asset can be sold, or the price paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.

The Group is required to classify the fair valuation method of the financial/non-financial assets and liabilities either measured or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements using a three-level fair value hierarchy (which reflects the significance of inputs used in the measurement of fair value). Accordingly, the Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data is available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.

The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:

-  Level 1 - Fair values derived on the basis of quoted (unadjusted) prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
-  Level 2 - Fair values derived on the basis significant inputs other than quoted prices within level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable.
-  Level 3 -Fair values derived on the basis valuation techniques that used significant inputs that are not based upon observable market data (unobservable inputs).

## Going concern

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. In making this going concern assessment, the Group has considered cash flow projections (including the scheduled bond repayment of $550m in May 2024 and repayment of other loans due for repayment in the going concern period) to June 2025 (going concern assessment period) under both a base case and reasonable worst-case scenarios, including reverse stress test. This assessment takes into consideration its principal risks and uncertainties, including a reduction in revenue and EBITDA and a devaluation of the various currencies in the countries in which the Group operates, including the Nigerian naira. As part of this evaluation, the Group has considered available ways to mitigate these risks and uncertainties and has also
