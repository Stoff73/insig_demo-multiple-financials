This section contains matters not covered elsewhere on which the directors are required to report each year.

## Profit and dividends

Statutory (loss)/profit for Airtel Africa after tax for 2023/24 was ($89m) (2022/23: $750m), and company profit after tax for 2023/24 was $219m (2022/23: $229m). Details of our dividend distribution during the year are set out on page 218 - see note 26.1 to the consolidated financial statements.

Subject to the approval of our shareholders, the directors have recommended a final dividend for the financial year ended 31 March 2024 of 3.57 cents per ordinary share, which will be paid out of distributable reserves. You can find more about the dividend, including key dates on our website at www.airtel.africa. On 30 October 2023, the Board declared an interim dividend of 2.38 cents per ordinary share, in line with our progressive dividend policy. This was paid on 15 December 2023 to shareholders who were on the UK and Nigerian share registers on 10 November 2023.

## Directors

The names of our current directors, along with their biographical details, are set out on pages 88-91 and are incorporated into this report by reference. Directors serving during the year are listed on page 105.

Details of directors' interests in our share capital are in our remuneration report on page 163.

Our Articles of Association govern the appointment, removal and replacement of our directors and explain the powers given to them.

## Avoiding conflicts of interest

The Board regularly reviews each director's interests outside Airtel Africa and considers how the chair ensures he is applying objective judgement in his role, as required by the UK Corporate Governance Code. To help directors avoid conflicts (or possible conflicts) of interest, the Board must first give clearance to any potential conflicts, including directorships or other interests in outside companies and organisations. This is recorded in a statutory register kept for this purpose.

If a director considers they are, or might be, interested in any contract or arrangement in which the company is or may be involved, they must give notice to the Board in line with the Companies Act 2006 and our Articles of Association. In this instance, unless allowed by the articles, the director cannot take part in any discussions or decisions about the contract or arrangement.

## Articles of Association

The Articles of Association can be amended in line with the Companies Act 2006 through a special shareholder resolution. The information below sets out the provisions in the Articles of Association in place at the date of this report.

## Share capital and control

We have one class of shares:

- Ordinary shares of $0.50 - each carries the right to one vote at our general meetings and other rights and obligations as set out below.

Following the conclusion of our AGM, Airtel Africa intends to apply its authority to purchase all deferred shares from their holders before proceeding to cancel the shares.

Details of our share capital movement during the year are set out in the consolidated statement of changes in equity on page 217.

## Capital reduction and creation of distributable reserves

We continue to simplify our capital structure. The Board has made significant progress in recent years in reducing leverage and strengthening our balance sheet.

At our July 2023 AGM, shareholders approved a capital reduction. This created additional distributable reserves that the company can use to facilitate returns to shareholders, whether as dividends, distributions or share buy-backs.

After this capital reduction, Airtel Africa share capital is 3,758,151,504 ordinary shares of USD $0.50 nominal value each, carrying one vote each. There are no shares held in treasury.

## Share buy-back

Given the levels of cash accretion and reduced leverage, and in view of our consistently strong operating cash generation, in March 2024 the Board launched a programme to buy back up to $100m of shares over a 12-month period. The Board believes that the buy-back will complement the existing dividend policy (growing mid to high single digits), reflecting the success of the strategy of cash accretion and reducing debt at the HoldCo level.

The Board believes this is an attractive use of capital in light of our long-term growth outlook. The programme uses the Group's own cash reserves and is in line with applicable securities laws and regulation.

Details of our share capital movement during the year are set out in the consolidated statement of changes in equity on page 217.

## Rights of members

There are no restrictions on the size of a holding, the exercise of voting rights, or the transfer of shares. The directors are not aware of any agreements between shareholders that might restrict the transfer of shares or voting rights.

## Share plans and rights under the employee share scheme

We operate an EBT for some employee share plans. The trustees of the EBT have all rights attached to Airtel Africa shares unless specifically restricted in the plan's governing document. Under these plans, we can satisfy entitlements by acquiring existing shares or issuing new shares. Existing shares are held in the trust. The trustee purchases shares in the open market as required to enable us to issue shares to satisfy awards that vest. The trustee does not register votes in respect of these shares at our AGMs and has waived the right to receive any dividends. At 31 March 2024, the EBT held 7,088,488 ordinary Airtel Africa shares. During the year, the EBT transferred 1,638,525 shares to satisfy the vesting of awards under our sharebased incentive plans.

## Purchase of own shares

The articles do not prevent Airtel Africa from purchasing its own shares. No one person has any rights of control over our share capital and all issued shares are fully paid.

## Major shareholders

Major shareholders have the same voting rights as other shareholders. We publish information given to us by substantial shareholders through the regulatory information service and on our website www.airtel.africa, in line with the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules (DTR). At 31 March 2024, we had been notified, in keeping with Rule 5, of the following holdings of ordinary share voting rights 2 :

## Significant agreements (change of control)

## Airtel Mobile Commerce BV (AMC BV)

Airtel Africa's borrowing and bank facilities contain the usual provisions which could potentially lead to prepayment and cancellation by the other party if there's a change of company control. There are no other significant contracts or agreements that would take effect, change or come to an end on a change of control following a takeover bid. All our share plans contain provisions for a change of control as summarised in the directors' remuneration report on page 153.

We do not have agreements with any director or employee that would compensate for loss of office or employment resulting from a takeover bid.

AMC BV, a wholly owned subsidiary of Airtel Africa, is currently the holding company for several of Airtel Africa's mobile money operations. It is intended to own and operate the mobile money businesses across all Airtel Africa's 14 operating countries once the inclusion of the remaining mobile money operations under AMC BV is completed.

Airtel Africa plc has sold minority equity stakes in AMC BV to four investors.
