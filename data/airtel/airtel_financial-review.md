## Financial review

## Revenue

Group revenue in reported currency declined by 5.3%, with constant currency growth of 20.9%, which accellerated to 23.1% in Q4'24. Reported currency revenue growth was particularly affected by significant currency devaluation in Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria and Zambia. Group mobile services revenue grew by 19.4%, with voice revenue growth of 11.9% and data revenue growth of 29.2%. In Nigeria, mobile services revenue increased by 25.8%, while in East Africa it grew by 21.5% and in Francophone Africa by 9.2%, respectively. Mobile money revenue grew by 32.8% in constant currency, driven primarily by continued strong growth in East Africa.

## EBITDA

In constant currency, EBITDA increased by 21.3% with EBITDA margin of 48.8%, up by 14bps. Reported currency EBITDA declined by 5.7% to $2,428m reflecting the impact of currency devaluation over the period. Reported currency EBITDA margin remained resilient despite the operating challenges we faced in many markets. Mobile services EBITDA increased by 18.8% in constant currency as operating leverage and cost efficiencies continued to limit the foreign exchange headwinds and inflationary pressures during the year. Mobile money EBITDA margin of 52.1% was up 234bps in constant currency, supporting growth of 39.0%.

## Finance costs

Total finance costs for the year ended 31 March 2024 were $1,703m, primarily impacted by $1,259m of derivative and foreign exchange losses (reflecting the revaluation impact of US dollar balance sheet liabilities and derivatives) as a result of currency devaluation across markets. Finance costs excluding derivative and foreign exchange losses increased from $385m to $444m in the current period primarily reflecting increased debt in the operating companies carrying a higher average interest rate.

Out of $1,259m of derivative and foreign exchange losses, $807m were classified as exceptional items as per the company's policy on exceptional items of which $770m is related to Nigerian naira devaluation and $37m is related to Malawian kwacha devaluation.

## (Loss)/Profit before tax

Loss before tax at $63m during the year ended 31 March 2024 was largely impacted by the $807m exceptional losses. Excluding these exceptional losses, profit before tax for the year ended 31 March 2024 was $744m.

## Taxation

Total tax charges were $26m as compared to $284m in the prior period. Total tax charges reflected an exceptional gain of $258m on account of the Nigerian naira and Malawian kwacha devaluations during the current period compared with deferred tax credit of $161m in the prior period, hence a higher exceptional gain of $97m. Tax charges, excluding exceptional items, were $284m compared to $445m in the prior period.

Tax charge of $26m during the year ended 31 March 2024, despite a loss before tax of $63m was due to witholding taxes on dividend by subsidiaries and change in profit mix between various OpCos.

## (Loss)/Profit after tax

Loss after tax at $89m during the year ended 31 March 2024 was primarily impacted by $549m net of tax impact of the exceptional derivative and foreign exchange losses. Excluding these exceptional losses, profit after tax for the year ended 31 March 2024 was $460m.

## Basic EPS

Basic EPS at negative 4.4 cents during the year ended 31 March 2024 was impacted by the derivative and foreign exchange losses as explained above. EPS before exceptional items and derivative and foreign exchange losses for year ended 31 March 2024 was 18.3 cents as compared to 20.5 cents in the prior period.

## Leverage

Leverage at 1.4x as of 31 March 2024 was flat from the previous year despite our significant investments and currency devaluation in several markets which resulted in lower reported currency EBITDA compared to prior period. The remaining debt at HoldCo is $550m, falling due in May 2024. Cash at HoldCo was around $680m at the end of the period, and the Group is expecting to fully repay the HoldCo debt when due using this cash.

## GAAP measures

## Revenue

Reported revenue of $4,979m declined by 5.3% in reported currency and grew by 20.9% in constant currency, driven by both customer base growth of 9% and ARPU growth of 10.7%. The constant currency revenue growth was offset by average currency devaluations between the periods, mainly in the Nigerian naira (97.1%), the Malawian kwacha (32.6%), the Zambian kwacha (25.1%) and the Kenyan shilling (20.4%), partially offset by appreciation in the Central African franc (4.1%).

Mobile services revenue grew by 19.4% in constant currency, supported by growth of 25.8% in Nigeria, 21.5% in East Africa and 9.2% in Francophone Africa, respectively. Mobile money revenue grew by 32.8% in constant currency, driven by revenue growth of 36.0% in East Africa and 22.3% in Francophone Africa, respectively.
