## Business reviews

Our CEO and function heads visit OpCos regularly to engage with teams - they then raise issues and concerns as needed to our Group ExCo. In monthly business reviews, regional directors and our CEO discuss the business health across functions and OpCos. This includes any important employee issues.

## HIVE

Our in-house portal allows us to share policies, employee news, internal job postings, CEO addresses, CSR and business and brand news across the business.

To develop our leaders, we ask for 360-degree feedback, including from direct reports and peers. This is then shared with each manager, their line manager and the HR team.

## Other

In February 2024, we invited our Executive Committee (ExCo), country MDs and their respective OpCo ExCo members to participate in the survey focused on the double materiality assessment. The survey was designed to assess the financial impact of ESG factors on our performance. Feedback was incorporated into our double materiality matrix.

## Board oversight

For other details of how the Board engaged with employees and was kept informed of their interests and concerns, see the focus on people and culture on page 118 and our Sustainability Report 2024.

## Interests and concerns

With 4,132 employees in Airtel Africa, interests and concerns are wide-ranging. Health and wellness continue to be an important issue, alongside career growth, rewards, and learning and development. People are also interested in providing support to the communities in which they live and work

Changing socio-political environments, rising inflation, higher taxation in some jurisdictions and currency devaluations have all led to an increase in the cost of living. This has had a direct impact on our employees, which we've managed to cushion to some extent through various interventions. Employees asked questions around the separation of the mobile money business and the impact this would have on the GSM business - as well as questions on the strategic and business plans around our data centre business, Nxtra by Airtel.

## Outcome and actions

Our CEO, together with other senior executives, welcomed the opportunity afforded by the town halls to respond directly in a conversational manner to employee questions directly on our business performance and organisational changes.

Continuing to understand and respond to the views of employees will allow us to attract, develop and retain a highly skilled, diverse and engaged workforce - and maintain a high-performance culture. The Board has overseen and approved several programmes and policies that support our people strategy.

To support employees' health and wellbeing, we provide medical check-ups at our offices and access to physical fitness sessions. We invite financial advisors to our workplaces to help employees manage their money, and our employee assistance programme provides access to professional counsellors.

We've also enhanced medical and life insurance across our OpCos to ensure comprehensive medical cover and competitive benefits that reflect our commitment to health and wellbeing.

As part of our retention planning we've put in place the Airtel Africa mobility programme, the 'Women in technology' programme, leadership development and short- and long-term incentives for employees. Employees also have opportunities to support people in their communities in areas such as education, health and wellbeing, and disaster relief.

## A closer look at… Our people and culture

## Understanding our people

Our Board engages with employees in various ways to understand how we can enhance our people strategy and continue to bring our values to life. To explore the business at all levels, directors are encouraged to engage with local operations, either by visiting in person or through online meetings, strategy sessions and quarterly reports from our HR committee. We arrange visits each year to operations, either individually or in small groups - and at least one Board meeting is scheduled to take place at a regional location with representatives from the business present.

This year, our annual leadership conclave took place in Dubai and allowed our employees to engage with Group leaders in person. It also created opportunities for employees to discuss both professional matters and learnings across our business. The leadership conclave also gives us the opportunity to cascade our vision and annual operating plan and to reward and recognise our best performing OpCos.

In addition, the Board stays on top of employee-related issues through:

-  Our open-door policy, where employees can connect directly with our CEO or any ExCo director about anything
-  Quarterly CEO-led town halls in English and French, where senior executives update employees on our business performance, organisational changes and take questions from employees
-  Remuneration Committee updates on remuneration, people, culture, conduct and diversity
-  Quarterly HR presentations to the Board on the progress of key HR projects, important talent acquisitions, project updates such as HR automation, and learning and development and performance management
-  Quarterly reports from the HR Forum and Remuneration Forum chair to the Remuneration Committee on people, culture and wellbeing
-  The results of our employee engagement survey and regular pulses shared in various OpCos and OpCo-led town halls our next all-employee survey will take place in July 2024
-  One-to-one meetings between our chair and ExCo members as well as ExCo and OpCo MDs and other leaders to discuss employee and personal wellbeing, team updates and career aspirations
-  Regular ExCo visits where leaders interact with teams at all levels of the business

## A closer look at… CEO engagement in action

In August 2023, our CEO visited Lilongwe, Malawi. There he interacted with the Airtel Malawi team and hosted an employee town hall. This provided helpful insight into people's concerns about currency devaluation and inflationary pressures and how this was affecting the livelihoods of the local team. He was able to share these concerns with the Board, which in turn influenced the year end salary review and helped to mitigate the impact of both headwinds on compensation. He also led a delegation to meet the President of the Republic of Malawi, Dr Lazarus McCarthy Chakwera. President Chakwera pledged to continue growing the government-to-business partnership with Airtel Africa to create meaningful socioeconomic value for all Malawians through pro-growth modern digital services.

Also in August 2023, Segun joined our Airtel Tanzania colleagues in Dar es Salaam for the launch of the Airtel 2Africa submarine cable and our 5G network. The event was attended by the President of the United Republic of Tanzania, Her Excellency Dr Samia Suluhu Hassan, senior government officials and other dignitaries. During the event, guests watched demonstrations of various applications of 5G technology in areas like agriculture, mining and health. In his speech, our CEO praised the government for providing a conducive environment for business and pledged Airtel Africa's support for the government's efforts to deliver a digital economy.

During the visit, our CEO also hosted an employee town hall to engage with the Airtel Tanzania team. With the insights gained during this trip, he returned to the Board seeking additional sites and towers to provide more coverage in the country. In return, he asked the local team to increase productivity from existing sites, which was achieved.

Both trips highlighted the good collaboration between our local teams and the respective governments in driving digital and financial inclusion.

Sunil Bharti Mittal is our designated Board director for employee engagement, given his regular travel to our OpCos. In this role, he is not expected to take on the responsibilities of an executive director or the chief HR officer.

He is responsible for supporting directors' collective responsibility to consider a wide range of stakeholder perspectives when making Board decisions, including:

-  Understanding the concerns of the workforce and articulating their views and concerns in Board meetings
-  Ensuring that the Board, particularly executive directors, take appropriate steps to evaluate the impact of proposals and developments on the workforce
-  Where relevant and appropriate, providing feedback to the workforce on Board decisions and direction during the engagement process
-  Making sure that feedback is gathered from all levels of the workforce in various locations

Each of our non-executive directors is invited to attend all quarterly employee town halls to hear feedback from employees and is encouraged to engage directly with employees when the opportunity arises. Feedback can then be shared immediately with the company secretary or chief HR officer, or with the Board at its next meeting.

## Developing our people

To improve employee engagement, we encourage skills development through short-term assignments and exchanges between OpCos.

Our flagship Airtel Africa mobility programme is designed to support talent retention, development and succession planning by giving high-potential and top-performing people exposure and learning opportunities through an accelerated career development programme. It allows employees from various OpCos to share knowledge and learn through long- and short-term global assignments.

This year, notable Airtel academy programmes included:

- Executive development programme - an immersive senior leadership programme based on psychometric assessments followed by feedback and coaching sessions.
- 'Women for technology' programme (W4T) - a one-year programme targeting high performing women employees in network-, engineering- and digital-related roles within the business.
- Finance IFRS training - International Financial Reporting Standards learning for all finance employees running for six months. In 2023/24, there were 152 participants, including 33 women.
- Engineering academy - our online learning platform with more than 15,000 courses giving teams access to the latest knowledge and skills in their fields.
- Network skills - through partnerships with Nokia, Ericsson and Huawei more than 2,700 courses were completed to significantly upgrade skills within the network functions.
- Airtel Money and SmartCash PSB - compliance training on anti-bribery, anti-terrorism and anti-money laundering as well as dedicated fintech programmes on compliance, cryptography and payments. 1,400+ courses completed over 500+ hours by 140+ HQ employees.
- AIL (India) elementary academy - a one-year programme to equip finance assistant managers and senior executives with relevant skills.

## Monitoring and shaping our culture

We understand the importance of setting the right tone from the top. Our Board places great emphasis on making sure our company culture reflects and reinforces our strategy, purpose, vision and core values. As such, one of our key focus areas is to monitor and assess the culture across Airtel Africa.

We recognise that our culture must welcome every person's unique contribution and, in doing so, celebrate diversity and inclusion in all its forms.

The Board monitors and assesses the culture of the Group in various ways. We meet with the ExCo and management, review the outcomes of employee surveys, engage directly with individual employees across the business and listen to feedback from our stakeholders. The chair meets with every member of the ExCo during the year and is also the non-executive director responsible for overseeing employee engagement. He shares his findings at each Board meeting. Every engagement with our colleagues and other stakeholders is an opportunity for learning, and this informs the actions and decisions of the Board.

In May, our chief compliance officer presented a risk management review paper to the Audit and Risk Committee. This set out the results of the review, as well as a culture action plan and Group compliance strategy. In guiding the committee through the culture plan, he explained the key drivers of organisational culture and our planned actions. These included using role models, incentives, explicit messages and governance structures - and also enhancing independent whistleblowing and assessment mechanisms. This plan was adopted by the committee and also endorsed by the Board.

## Engaging with our stakeholders continued

## A closer look at… Monitoring our culture

To meet its 2023/24 objectives of assessing and monitoring our culture and promoting the alignment of culture with our purpose, vision and core values and strategy, our Board participated in certain key activities during the year.

This is in addition to critical skills training in IT and data security and other leadership programmes. During the financial year, more than 238,475 courses were completed on our digital training platform. Our total investment into training and development programmes in 2023/24 is $1.2m. In response to our 2022/23 employee engagement survey, wedeveloped our Group-wide app-based employee assistance programme to enhance our people's wellbeing. |

## Provision 41: engagement with the workforce

The Board is satisfied that we complied with Provision 41 of the Code during 2023/24.

As described, we engaged with employees on several issues, including remuneration, in a variety of ways. Through various types of meetings and engagement, our Board informs employees on executive remuneration and hears their feedback. We continually seek to improve the Board's dialogue with employees and review our approach regularly.

The topic of engaging with our people forms part of the chief HR officer's report to each Board meeting. Copies of our Annual Report detailing the executive directors' remuneration are widely shared and available for employees to see on our website.

During our annual strategy meeting and Q3'24 Board and committee meetings in Dubai (UAE), the Board met both formally and informally with our wider management team and other colleagues. A similar opportunity is offered to employees attending the Q&amp;A session following quarterly Group-wide town hall meetings.

The Board reviews the results of the employee survey conducted every other year - last time in 2022 - particularly around employee engagement levels benchmarked against peers and how our values link to our purpose, vision and behaviour. The Board identifies actions and policy changes needed to address the insights gained from the employee survey. It monitors the progress of any actions taken through the CEO's monthly reports and the quarterly people updates and presentations by our chief HR officer.

At our Board meeting in January 2024, we agreed that Board members would meet regularly and virtually with a selection of different people who are representative of their part of the business. These conversational meetings are designed to provide non-executive directors with an opportunity to increase their visibility with the workforce and gain insights into the culture and concerns at different levels of the business, and provide colleagues with an opportunity to share ideas and concerns with the non-executive directors. We will report on the impact of these meetings next year.

## Our communities

With operations in 14 African countries, we live and work closely with our communities, doing all we can to support their needs and create positive change.

## How we engaged during the year

The services we provide put Airtel Africa at the heart of local communities, and we're proud of the role we play in connecting individuals, businesses and societies across Africa. Listening and talking to the communities in which we live and work is fundamental to how we run our business. Our OpCos use various channels in community communications to ensure accessibility for different audience groups. These include face-to-face meetings, letters, emails, text messages, social media campaigns and traditional media activity.

We encourage open and transparent communications. Our communities can share their interests and concerns with OpCos and regional offices over a range of channels, including phone, email and social media. We also actively engage with governments and other organisations about community issues and initiatives to get their input and feedback where useful.

Our colleagues are also able to engage with their communities through volunteering opportunities and providing company donations to support local people.

## Board oversight

Each quarter, the Board is updated on community issues, requests and concerns, as well as progress in our community initiatives. The Board hears regular reports from the CEO and sustainability team and also presentations by regional and country management teams.

In October and November 2023, Board members visited Kenya and Nigeria and, while they were there, visited some community schools supported by Airtel Africa.

- For more information, see our Sustainability Report 2024 published on www.airtel.africa

## Interests and concerns

People in our communities have many concerns and interests - these are at the heart of our business strategy. This year, people in our communities shared these priorities and concerns:

1. Access to quality education young people are being held back by things like inadequate classrooms, furniture and books as well as the high cost of data and devices for connecting to the internet.
2. Environment Africa is already reeling from the impact of global warming, including flooding, hurricanes and earthquakes.
3. Equitable water distribution this continues to be a major problem across our markets.
4. Protection of natural resources Africa continues to face challenges such as soil erosion and land degradation, deforestation, biodiversity loss, poaching and loss of wetlands due to human activity, urbanisation and agricultural expansion.

## Outcome and actions

We work with communities and governments across our markets to transform the lives of some of the most vulnerable people on the continent.

We continue to focus on transforming lives through increasing access to education to help bring lasting change in communities across Africa. We believe education is critical to closing the opportunity gap in our communities and help every young person fulfil their potential. Where specific local needs arise, we also provide tailored support and solutions in areas such as healthcare, disaster relief, and digital and financial inclusion.

In light of the double materiality assessment carried out across our stakeholder groups in March 2024, we take a proactive approach to conserving our environment by ensuring that our products, operations and services are safe and have a minimal impact on the environment. We carry out environmental risk assessments across our business operations and have robust mitigation plans to address potential negative impacts that might affect communities in areas where we operate. We're constantly improving our environmental management system to ensure our activities contribute as little as possible to climate change, pollution and biodiversity loss. This is an integral part of our sustainability strategy and particularly our environment pillar.

This year, we extended the impact of our landmark five-year partnership with UNICEF, championing digital education through online platforms, connectivity and access to digital learning: 13 of our OpCos have launched initiatives in line with three pillars of this partnership:

1.    Advocacy for education, especially among girls
2.    Provision of access to government-approved educational websites and online platforms free of charge
3.    Connecting schools to the internet

As of 31 March 2024, we connected 960 schools and provided free access to 23 zero-rated educational websites and learning platforms.

## Engaging with our stakeholders continued

## Our partners and suppliers

We work with more more than 2,700 partners and suppliers across Africa, including mobile brands, IT companies and telecoms infrastructure providers - with the top 100 vendors and suppliers accounting for 87% of our procurements.

## How we engaged during the year

Strong partnerships with vendors and suppliers have always been an integral part of our business model, and in 2023/24 suppliers continued to engage with us to discuss win-win solutions.

We continually review relationships with our strategic and material partners and suppliers. We do this through formal supplier surveys, reviews and audits. We also initiated regular top tier partners' roundtables for targeted sustainability initiatives.

The Group also continually monitors policies and procedures around supplier payment practices, including those relating to the Group key suppliers, to ensure that they continue to meet wider industry standards.

In 2023/24, we continued to engage with our top suppliers at both HQ and OpCo level. This included governance meetings, commercial meetings and, where necessary, grievance meetings. Our CEO met peers from our top suppliers regularly during the year, and our OpCo teams discussed operational matters with suppliers at country level.

Our senior leadership team, including the chair and CEO, was able to engage with a number of key suppliers at the MWC event in Barcelona in February 2024 and at the industry-wide GITEX convention in Dubai in October 2023. The chair shared an account of his meetings with the Board.

We also hosted an event in December 2023 in Dubai (UAE) during COP28 in association with the ABLC (United Nations' Africa business leaders' coalition) where we engaged with senior executives from our peer organisations. We also chose this event to launch our scope 3 decarbonisation programme as part of our journey towards a net zero future. It was also an excellent opportunity to reinforce the 'call to action' on the African continent.

In February 2024, we engaged with our top partners and other suppliers at the Capacity Middle East 2024 convention. This is the region's leading meeting for digital infrastructure, connecting 2,600+ key ICT players from the Middle East and beyond, representing carrier, cloud, peering, hyperscale, content, finance, edge, software, equipment, data centre and satellite industries.

Another key element of engagement in October 2023 was the annual ESG self-assessment questionnaire (SAQ) where our top 100 vendors and suppliers were asked to complete a survey and provide us with deeper insights into the ESG developments withon our value chain and highlight areas for future improvements. For the results of this survey, see page 21 of the Sustainability Report 2024.

We also updated our policies and processes to ensure an ethical supply chain, including our human rights policy, environmental policy, stakeholder engagement policy, responsible marketing policy and the Code of Business Ethics for partners and suppliers.

## Board oversight

Our Board is kept informed about supply chain initiatives through the CEO's monthly Board report and Board presentations from the chief supply chain officer and the sustainability team.

## Interests and concerns

Our engagement with suppliers revealed these main areas of concern this year:

-  Our scope 3 strategy and reducing the environmental impact of the value chain
-  ESG topics more broadly
-  The economic situation in some countries - navigating the economic situation in markets with high inflation and currency devaluation
-  Supply chain integrity

Not only were ESG topics an important area of engagement this year for our suppliers, but they also continue to be central for us. In November 2023, we held our first roundtable with top tier partners to discuss the approach and long-term ambition to reach net zero ahead of 2050.

Our top tier partners endorsed our approach to reducing scope 3 emissions, and we published our scope 3 decarbonisation programme on 30 November 2023 (see www.airtel.africa for details). One of the key elements of this programme is the partner and suppliers' engagement programme (PSEP) which focuses on setting long-term decarbonisation targets across the value chain.

## Outcomes and actions

This year, we continued to discuss sales and project plans, bids and proposals, and ways to expand our collaboration to help suppliers take full advantage of developing technologies.

On ESG-related matters, we made significant progress in a number of areas in rolling out our sustainability strategy in our 14 markets. For more information about our progress, see pages 14-38 of our Sustainability Report 2024.

In February 2024, we conducted a double materiality assessment with our top 100 partners and suppliers. The results of this survey underpin the updated materiality matrix mapping out identified sustainability topics based on their impact on both financial performance and external stakeholders' interests. See our double materiality matrix on page 9 of the Sustainability Report 2024.

Our recent ESG survey of our top 100 vendors and suppliers had a 76% response rate. This gives us valuable data on environmental impacts in our value chain to inform our long-term decarbonisation strategy. The survey also identified opportunities where we can add the most value in aligning our ESG principles with our supply chain.

At the same time, fuel shortages and price increases in a number of markets accelerated the partnership programmes we have with key partners and suppliers to create a more renewable carbon approach to our operations.

We also used our membership of the joint audit cooperation (JAC) to good effect. This is an association of telecom operators aiming to verify, assess and develop ESG implementation across the manufacturing centres of the most important multinational suppliers. Members share resources and best practices to implement ESG practices at various layers of the international supply chain.

In 2023/24, we completed five audits of JAC members giving us insights into the ESG practices of our partners and suppliers. JAC membership also provides a shared platform where members across the telecoms industry can see the audit results of all suppliers.

## Governments and regulators

We engage closely with governments and regulators in all our markets, supporting their ambitions for digital and financial inclusion while working to create a viable business environment in which we can create shared value. This helps us communicate effectively with the people who implement the policies, laws and regulations that affect our business.

## How we engaged during the year

Our stakeholder engagement plan provides broad guidance on who should engage with governments and regulators on behalf of the company, depending on the seriousness and materiality of the issue under discussion.

This engagement can take various forms. For serious and material issues, we rely on formal channels. This might involve us writing to a regulator or government department on an issue of concern or holding a formal minuted meeting. Other engagement happens at informal government events, product launches and industry gatherings. We also engage through local industry associations and international industry associations, including the global telecoms association GSMA.

Our Board continues to have a productive and open dialogue with regulatory bodies and policymakers and sets high standards of governance across our business. Paul Arkwright, the special advisor to the chair and the Board advises directors on political, legal and regulatory issues around our strategy in Africa. The Board has empowered the CEOs and chief regulatory officers of our OpCos to represent them at country-level engagements with governments and regulators. Management also informs the Board about regulatory developments in the markets each month. From time to time, we also commission audits to verify levels of regulatory compliance.

## Board oversight

Regulatory issues pose both opportunities and threats to our business. To manage these issues, the Board relies on a number of governance processes to guide directors in determining issues that require focused attention.

The chief regulatory officer reports monthly to the Board on material regulatory developments across our markets. Materiality is determined by the focus of the Board, a value or financial impact of $1m or more, and potential impact on our business reputation. The Board is also updated on regulatory developments when needed by a special advisor, our Group company secretary, regional directors and other subject matter experts.

The Board also has a Regulatory Affairs Committee. This is chaired by Paul Arkwright and consists of our chief regulatory officer and the regional directors of our Nigeria, East Africa and Francophone Africa businesses. The committee meets quarterly and is updated by our chief regulatory officer on regulatory developments and stakeholder engagements to inform our approach.

## Interests and concerns

This year, governments and regulators showed a particular interest in:

-  Revenue collection and national security
-  Tax collection - connected to a need to boost government revenues due to subdued national economies
-  Compliance with Know Your Client (KYC) and quality of service (QoS) requirements - underpinned by national security concerns as well as making sure consumers have network quality

Digital inclusion also continues to interest governments and regulators. Operators have been encouraged to meet the coverage obligations in their licences by addressing coverage gaps and ensuring that rural, underserved and unserved populations have access to telecoms and mobile financial services. Meeting coverage gaps in a cost-effective manner has been a major focus area for our company.

Regulators are also continuing to make spectrum available to operators to help them offer high-speed data services and increase broadband penetration. 4G and 5G targeted spectrum continues to be released.

Regulators have also continued to license mobile financial and fintech services. Central banks have been very supportive of our Airtel Money separation. This reinforces their belief that the mobile financial services business will be adequately financed and able to offer financial services to the unbanked.

## Outcomes and actions

We understand governments' focus on revenues, and we continue to meet our tax obligations, being recognised as among the largest taxpayers in most of our countries of operation. Alongside this, we seek to demonstrate to governments that their societies benefit from the shared value we create wherever we operate and advocate equitable taxation across all sectors of the economy. This is supported by our sustainability strategy.

We ensure that all our activities are properly licensed and use our compliance management system to ensure that all our operations comply with licence obligations. We closely monitor compliance with KYC and anti-money laundering requirements, which are a special focus area for governments fighting terrorism, money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Our enhanced compliance management programme helps management identify areas of non-compliance early enough to make corrections before the regulator intervenes.

We also monitor the quality of our network to make sure it meets regulators' QoS standards, and that their citizens enjoy affordable coverage and a reliable service.

Specific actions this year towards increasing digital and financial inclusion include:

-  Partnering with Meta to land 2Africa submarine cable in four of our markets (the DRC, Kenya, Republic of the Congo and Tanzania) this provides high-speed internet access cost effectively and increases digital inclusion
-  Partnering with OneWeb in a number of our countries so that businesses and communities not served by terrestrial networks can be reached by satellite
-  Our Airtel Telesonic companies are focused squarely on investing in, building, managing and operating national fibre to ensure less downtime and improve service quality. These are various stages of getting infrastructure licences

## Engaging with our stakeholders continued

## Shareholders

Through their investments, our shareholders enable us to deliver our strategy and create long-term value for all stakeholders.

## How we engaged during the year

During the year, as part of a proactive engagement programme organised by our investor relations team, we held conversations with shareholders through a mix of group and one-to-one meetings.

Our investor relations team maintains a two-way dialogue between the investment community and Group management, executives and the Board. At the same time, we keep a range of channels open for communication, including this Annual Report, our Sustainability Report 2024 and:

-  Detailed quarterly financial statements and press releases with key financial and operational updates
-  Live conference calls and presentations held at each quarterly results announcement
-  Ad hoc shareholder and prospective shareholder meetings and calls throughout the year
-  Virtual and in-person roadshows with senior management following the publication of full year, and half year results in May and October 2023 - followed by formal feedback gathering from investors
-  Several virtual and in-person investor conferences attended by the investor relations team to engage with existing and prospective shareholders
-  Proactive engagement with the sell-side equity research community
-  Our virtual and in-person AGM, giving shareholders the opportunity to engage with our Board of directors and ask questions
-  Regular corporate website updates for investors to access investorspecific information on financial, operating and sustainability issues affecting Airtel Africa, including updates on key policies to enhance ESG ratings

## Board oversight

The Board receives a detailed report on shareholder engagement, interests and concerns every month. This also includes:

-  The share price performance and current valuation multiples we benchmark the performance of our shares and the company's valuation to industry peers to create an understanding of relative performance
-  A summary of key developments across the industry that affects both Airtel Africa and our industry peers
-  A detailed analysis of consensus expectations to understand market expectations for the company compared to internal expectations
-  An update on the composition of the shareholder register with a focus on key buyers and sellers over the past month
-  An update on research published by sell-side analysts

Corporate brokers also present regularly to the Board at quarterly meetings.

The CEO, CFO and head of investor relations meet regularly with institutional investors to discuss strategic issues and to make presentations on our results.

Committee chairs are also available to engage with major shareholders regarding their areas of responsibility. Non-executive directors develop an understanding of the views of major shareholders through regular updates from the head of investor relations and external advisors.

## Interests and concerns

Our shareholders were focused on five key areas this year.

## 1. Sustaining growth across our markets

Investors are concerned about the potential impact on our revenue of challenging macroeconomic environments and consumer pressures due to inflation. In addition, there remains continued discussion around the strong growth of our mobile money business, including the potential upcoming IPO. Additional avenues of growth, including the data centre business, also gained traction over the year following the launch of Nxtra by Airtel in December 2023.

## 2. Defending profitability given currency headwinds and inflationary pressure on cost base

The recent significant FX headwinds in some markets and rise in inflation has generated concerns about our ability to sustain high levels of profitability across the Group. We explained to investors how we've sought to limit impact by controlling our exposure to US dollar operating costs and focusing our attention on growing revenues ahead of inflation.

## 3. FX concerns and access to US dollars to fund capex/ shareholder returns

Investors were concerned about our exposure to FX volatility across our markets, particularly in Nigeria. They also had concerns around the requirement for cash to fund capital expenditure, HQ operating expenditure, HQ debt refinancing obligations and shareholder returns.

We explained how we aim to address these concerns:

-  Communicating that we're a diverse business with 14 OpCos. While Nigeria is our largest market, we're not reliant on any particular market to meet our needs
-  Providing a sensitivity analysis to show how currency devaluation was likely to affect revenues, EBITDA and finance costs
-  Derisking our balance sheet, with over 83% of OpCo debt now in local currency (compared to over 64% in March 2023)
-  Upstreaming US dollar cash to derisk exposure at HQ. We have around $680m of cash at HoldCo to repay the HoldCo bond due in May 2024, using this cash
-  Continuing to upstream cash from OpCos to fund shareholder returns - this confidence has been reflected in the Board's decision to approve a share buy-back

## 4. Shareholder returns

The ability and willingness of a company to maintain and grow its dividend through its progressive dividend policy reflects confidence in its operating performance and outlook. It also reflects a strong commitment to shareholder value. The recent launch of our first share buy-back further supports this investor priority.

## 5. Sustainability

Investors are increasingly interested in our sustainability commitments. During the year we saw improved ESG ratings, reflecting continued success in financial and digital inclusion, the publication of 'Our journey towards a net zero future', and increased transparency around our policies.

## Outcomes and actions

Our Board is kept well informed of the views of shareholders and is able to take them into account when taking major strategic and operational decisions. This year we:

-  Approved a share buy-back of up to $100m over a 12-month period from March 2024
-  Actively engaged with shareholders and analysts around progress on derisking our balance sheet
-  Communicated the demand for our telecoms and mobile money services across our markets, which was reflected in resilient revenue growth trends despite a challenging macro environment
-  Highlighted our ability to sustain growth at a high level (to limit FX impacts), by offering affordable services to customers. The growth strategy is predicated on strong customer growth and increased usage - not on widespread tariff increases
-  Reiterated our continued investment into our networks to futureproof the business for growth

## Media

## How we engaged during the year

How people absorb and transmit information is undergoing huge change. Despite this, the established media - whether print, broadcast or online - remains influential: trusted and authoritative sources of information with incredible reach. This is why media relations is a core part of our communications activity.

We appreciate the strong relationships we have with journalists, and also between their media organisations and Airtel Africa at Group and OpCo levels.

We build and nurture these long-term mutually beneficial relationships in a range of ways. These span media briefings with our spokespeople (at both Group and OpCo levels), press releases, thought leadership, events and strategic media partnerships. We regularly update the Media Centre on our website with our latest news so that journalists can quickly and easily access relevant information, wherever they are in the world.

See our recent press releases:

https://airtel.africa/#/pages/media?tab=press\_releases

The Media Centre also has a feedback facility, and we use this to understand media interests and concerns:

https://airtel.africa/#/pages/media?tab=media\_contact

## Board oversight

We share key media feedback and coverage results on a regular basis with the Board.

## Interests and concerns

Our landmark partnership with UNICEF gained significant media traction across Africa. Coverage was sparked by launch events, joint profiling and thought leadership with UNICEF - and also by UN awareness days, such as the international day of women and girls in science.

The visit by our chair and CEO to the new president of Nigeria, President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, attracted much media coverage particularly around our chair's comments on the removal of government subsidy on petroleum products and the floating of the naira exchange rate.

Other events which attracted significant Africa-wide media coverage included:

-  The presentation by our CEO at the GSMA event in Kigali, Rwanda
-  Airtel Rwanda's October 2023 launch of low-cost 4G phones in partnership with the Rwandan government
-  The launch of our cable landing station and 5G in Tanzania
-  Our CEO's published opinion piece on World Teachers' Day

## Outcomes and actions

Our communications strategy focuses on corporate and leadership profiling, building compelling sustainability narratives and instilling good practices for consistent and aligned story telling across our OpCos.

This year, we delivered a regular flow of thought leadership and positioning opportunities in the media, with a total of 199 positive opinion articles attributed to our CEO. These pieces contained high-impact messaging around our commitment to transforming lives through education, as well as the transformative impact of digital and financial inclusion in unlocking Africa's potential.

## NGOs

## How we engaged during the year

NGOs usually approach Airtel Africa initially by writing to OpCo managing directors requesting sponsorship or a contribution to a particular project. This is then followed up by the relevant OpCo.

In Kenya, for example, engagement with NGOs focuses on three key areas:

1.    Assessing strategic alignment and goal-setting - we make sure potential NGO partners are addressing issues connected to the problems we aim to solve (for example, connectivity, education and financial inclusion). This alignment with our core values, sustainability goals and mission creates a strong foundation for collaboration.
2.    Clear communication channels - we establish open and transparent communication channels to ensure effective coordination and understanding. For example, Airtel Kenya and Kenya Red Cross communicate regularly through emails and virtual calls.
3.    Measurable goals and metrics - see below for examples of 2023/24 achievements.

With our major partner UNICEF, we have regular virtual and face-toface meetings to track progress at both Group and OpCo level. In February 2024, we held our annual Airtel Africa/UNICEF partnership convention in Dubai (UAE) with OpCo CSR representatives and their UNICEF counterparts attending for a two-day planning workshop.

## Engaging with our stakeholders continued

## Board oversight

Our Board is kept informed of and approves NGO matters by country through CEO and CFO reports and through the quarterly Board sustainability report. These reports allow the Board to understand the interests and priorities of NGOs, the benefits and opportunities the relationship provides, and our ongoing engagement activities.

## Interests and concerns

Access to quality education was one of the top priorities for our NGO partners. We were able to source devices for 'last mile' connectivity and internet access and make data more accessible in certain the countries.

-  In Gabon, the NGOs asked us to provide internships for young women as well as SIM cards for the Libreville Handicap Association to open Airtel Money accounts so members could create revenuegenerating businesses.
-  In Kenya, our NGO partner wants to help communities to respond to humanitarian emergencies to minimise people's suffering. It's working to transform and enrich lives through various community programmes.

## Outcome and actions

We supported our NGO partners in their goals to empower local communities in many ways:

-  Airtel Gabon provided SIM cards and opened Airtel Money accounts for members of the Libreville Handicap Association. Airtel Gabon also offered a three-month internship to ten local women to learn about various business practices across departments.
-  Airtel Kenya distributed food to 1,000 households in areas affected by famine. As part of our WASH programme, we also rehabilitated four boreholes and drilled a new one in drought-stricken areas to provide a sustainable water supply and access to fresh water for more than 2,000 households.
-  Airtel Zambia worked to support quality education to vulnerable children in far flung areas away from railway lines. We adopted two schools in two provinces and refurbished them to facilitate a good learning standard.
-  Airtel Uganda supported the National Library of Uganda by providing internet access and Kawempe Public Library, where out-of-school young people can use computers and train in basic ICT skills.
- For more details about our commitment to tranform lives through access to quality education, see pages 32-33 of our Sustainability Report 2024

Progress under our flagship partnership with UNICEF championing digital education through online platforms and connectivity included:

1.    Launching the partnership in 13 OpCos by 31 March 2024
2.    Connecting c.1,200 schools to the internet as of 31 March 2024
3.    Providing 1.7 million of schoolchildren with access to digital learning free of charge
4.    Creating more awareness for the UNICEF partnership across our markets

## Stakeholder engagement in action

The Board recognises the need to foster positive relationships with all our stakeholders to build a sustainable business. This section provides more details on how directors have fulfilled their duties.

The matters we consider differ in relevance for each stakeholder group, and sometimes stakeholders have conflicting interests. We aim to consider the key issues relevant to each group and make decisions that support our vision, purpose, strategy and long-term success.

## A closer look at… How we considered stakeholder interests during the year

## Consideration

Shareholder returns

## Stakeholder

Our investors

## Outcome and impact on long-term success

The Board recognises the importance of shareholder returns and during the year rewarded shareholders by recommending, subject to the approval of shareholders, a final dividend of 3.57 cents per ordinary share for the year ended 31 March 2024. It also approved an interim dividend of 2.38 cents per ordinary share on 30 October 2023.

In August 2023, the Board announced the cancellation and extinction of our deferred shares of USD 0.50 nominal value - the capital reduction. The effect of the capital reduction is to create additional distributable reserves available for the company to use to facilitate shareholder returns, whether in the form of dividends, distributions or share buy-backs.

In its deliberations, the Board considered its progressive dividend policy and the Group's strong financial performance, including its cash position and distributable reserves. The Board also considered shareholder views.

In Q4'24 the Board also approved a share buy-back programme of $100m. The Board believes that repurchasing its own shares is an attractive use of its capital in light of the Group's long-term growth outlook.

The Board concluded that approving these dividends and share buy-backs is in the best interests of the company and the shareholders. In making theses decisions, the Board balanced the interests of all stakeholder groups and believed it was in the best interest of the company to proceed.

The double materiality assessment*

Our stakeholders

## Outcome and impact on long-term success

In February 2024, we conducted a double materiality assessment with our stakeholder groups, including partners and suppliers, to make sure our disclosed information is relevant to stakeholders and addresses concerns both crucial to the business and meaningful to those engaged with it.

This builds on our work in 2021 in undertaking a detailed materiality assessment. The results indicated areas of sustainability risk and those in which we could make a positive impact - and this served as a foundation on which to build our sustainability strategy.

An important part of the sustainability reporting process is to regularly identify, revise and prioritise the most significant sustainability issues for Airtel Africa and its stakeholders. This helps us build credibility and trust by showing a clear understanding of what matters most to our business and our stakeholders.

* An evaluation of the company's impact on society and environment combined with an assessment of the impact of social and environmental issues on company's financial and operational performance.

Celebrating data privacy week in January 2024: 'Take control of your data'

## Stakeholder

Our people

Our customers

Our suppliers

## Outcome and impact on long-term success

We joined with other organisations in marking the international data privacy week by raising awareness about data privacy and security. The goal was to educate people and organisations on the importance of safeguarding personal data. As a responsible custodian of the data of our employees, customers, suppliers and business partners, we have robust policies, processes, technical and organisational safeguards to protect the personal data entrusted to us.

Data is a key competitive advantage for our business, as we deepen digital and financial inclusion across our markets. It's the responsibility of every employee to make sure we protect the data of the stakeholders that we gather as part of our day-to-day activities and to comply with our data privacy and protection policy, information security policy and IT security guidelines.

During the data privacy week, the data protection officers across our OpCos worked with the Group compliance team to create engaging activities to raise awareness around data privacy. Every employee was urged to participate and learn how to take control of their own data and protect the personal data of our stakeholders. Daily updates were delivered to every employee's inbox. In making these decisions the Board balanced the interests of all stakeholder groups and believed it was in the best interest of the company to proceed.

## Chair's statement

## Dear shareholder

On behalf of the Audit and Risk Committee, I'm delighted to present our report for the year ended 31 March 2024. This report gives an insight into the work carried out by our committee and our discussions and focus during the year. Our committee continued to fulfil its responsibilities to a high standard by providing effective independent oversight, with the support of management and internal and external audit.

Our members are unchanged. We remain a team of independent non-executive directors with the financial experience, commercial acumen and industry knowledge to fulfil our responsibilities.

In these challenging macroeconomic times, we continue to focus on ensuring the integrity of Airtel Africa's financial information and the effectiveness of its risk management, controls and related processes.

As part of my commitment to connect with my management colleagues in person, during the year l visited our operating entities in Zambia and Nigeria. On these visits I met and spoke with local management, who gave me valuable insights into their operations and risk management control frameworks.

## Key areas of focus

We continued this year to look in depth at certain aspects of the control environment, particularly the presumed risk of management override of controls and those relating to fraud management, IT security and cyber risk. Considering the recent separation of the mobile money business from GSM, we increased our focus on mobile money internal controls and compliance across our geographies. Our committee took deep dives into the monitoring and reporting of Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICOFR) and non-ICOFR key controls to strengthen compliance and monitoring for mobile money.

This focus on mobile money was in addition to our ongoing review of ICOFR and non-ICOFR controls for the GSM business and revenue assurance. For non-ICOFR controls, the internal audit team walked the committee through the control coverage to show that key high-risk processes had been incorporated. They also confirmed that the scoring and rating mechanism would be similar to those used for GSM. The findings of internal audit reviews during the year in each of these areas were shared with our committee.

We also reviewed Airtel Africa's principal and emerging risks. Given the geopolitical operating environment in some of the markets in which we operate, we added a new principal risk: geopolitical risks and adverse macroeconomic conditions. Technology obsolescence was removed as a standalone principal risk and is now part of the technology resilience and business continuity risk.

As part of the committee's oversight of the culture, compliance and controls environment across the Group, this year we started to invite to each meeting in turn the CEO and CFO of each operating country. They present on the risk and control environment under their watch, including a qualitative assessment and overview of the continuous controls in place, the risk and fraud environment, the quality of the current talent and bench strength in the finance team and the state of the IT systems. So far we've had presentations from the DRC, Uganda and Zambia. Apart from valuable insights into local compliance and controls environments, this approach has also brought a helpful understanding of operational and political risks and the strength of local teams.

The Group continued to experience macroeconomic environment challenges across our geographies, with FX headwinds in many of our markets and specifically in Nigeria and Malawi. So our committee paid special attention to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations and shortage of foreign currency. We reviewed management's presentation of the impact on the business and ensured appropriate disclosures were made in the financial statements, including, for example, around exceptional items and constant currency. Principal and emerging risks and significant judgements made in connection with these risks are set out on page 74.

In line with previous reviews, we examined in detail the interplay between the mandatory Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and our sustainability reporting. Our committee is comfortable with the approach adopted.

- For our TCFD disclosures, see pages 63-68 of the strategic report

During the year, we also considered the full year and half year results and the Q1'24 and Q3'24 trading updates. We gave special attention to the quality of accounting policies and practices as well as judgements and disclosures on key accounting matters, particularly the significant devaluation of the Nigerian naira and Malawian kwacha currencies. In line with the Group policy on exceptional items, our committee agreed that the impact of these structural and material currency devaluations should be classified as exceptional items to enhance comparability of underlying operations over time. This entails the devaluation in the Nigerian naira seen in Q1'24 and Q4'24 and the devaluation of the Malawi kwacha seen in Q3'24.

We also continued to monitor the integrity of our financial statements and the effectiveness of both the internal and external audit processes.

The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) wrote to Airtel Africa in February 2024 informing us that it had reviewed our interim report for the period ended 30 September 2023 in accordance with Part 2 of the FRC Corporate Reporting Review Operating Procedures. Our committee considered the FRC suggestions on improvements to our existing reporting and these are incorporated into this Annual Report.

## Our schedule of meetings

In addition to scheduled committee meetings, we met regularly independently of management, with both external and internal auditors and are satisfied that neither is being unduly influenced by management. I also hold regular meetings with our CFO and other members of management to better understand the issues that need discussion at committee meetings. As committee chair, I regularly engage with key stakeholders, including Group Internal Assurance, senior management and our external auditor on committee work.

Our committee report is structured into five parts:

Part 1 - Our work during the year

Part 2 - Key transactions, judgements and estimates and our response

Part 3 - Risk management and internal controls

Part 4 - External auditors

Part 5 - Finance Committee

We continued to operate with openness and transparency, and a spirit of robust challenge when necessary, to make sure our shareholders and other stakeholders are protected.

## Future focus

Looking ahead to 2024/25, our committee will continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions, including currency devaluations, affecting the Group's performance and assets. We'll oversee the development of plans to meet the requirements of the new UK Corporate Governance Code, including an effectiveness review and certification of internal controls. Over the past few years, while waiting on the finalisation of regulatory reforms governing internal controls, we've made significant progress in enhancing our internal controls by voluntarily formalising the implementation of an ICOFR framework. Several improvements were made to the ICOFR framework: continuous evaluation of both key and non-key controls, enhancements of the design and operating effectiveness of controls, ongoing monitoring, independent effectiveness testing and reporting. In light of our continual improvements in internal controls, Deloitte took a controls reliance approach to our internal controls in certain areas as part of its statutory audit procedures during the reporting period.

Our committee will also continue to focus on the control and compliance environment for the Airtel Money business as it prepares for an IPO. We'll continue to look at and strengthen the focus on compliance across all levels and functions in the organisation using various measures including training, process improvements, automation and robust consequence management policies to hold people accountable for their actions.

I'd like to thank the management team at Airtel Africa and each of the committee members for their support and contribution during the year.

I welcome questions from shareholders on this committee's activities. To discuss any aspect of this report, please contact me through our company secretary, Simon O'Hara (see page 254 for contact details). I'll be also attending the 2024 AGM and look forward to the opportunity to meet and speak with you there.

## Ravi Rajagopal

Chair, Audit and Risk Committee 8 May 2024

## Committee governance

## Key responsibilities

Our committee is responsible for overseeing:

-  Accounting and financial reporting
-  The role and mandate of the Internal Audit function
-  The selection, appointment and management of the relationship with the external auditor
-  Internal control and risk management systems

In May 2023, the FRC published the Minimum Standard on Audit Committees. Following consideration of the requirements of the standard, we added new responsibilities to our terms of reference. These included requirements to manage a balance of choice of audit firms for providing non-audit services and engaging with shareholders on the scope of external audit.

Detailed responsibilities are set out in our committee's terms of reference, which can be found at www.airtel.africa/investors/ governance.

## Composition

Our committee consists of four independent non-executive directors: Ravi Rajagopal (chair), Andy Green, Annika Poutiainen and Awuneba Ajumogobia. The Board believes these directors have the necessary range of financial, risk, control and commercial experience required to effectively challenge management.

The Board is satisfied that Ravi Rajagopal has recent and relevant financial experience. Ravi held financial leadership roles at Diageo until retiring in 2015, including group controller in the UK and global head of mergers and acquisitions. His skills in finance, and control and risk have been developed over a career working in senior strategy and management roles. As a qualified chartered accountant, Ravi has lectured at Oxford University and Imperial College.

As a collective, we have a thorough understanding of the telecoms and mobile money services sectors and emerging markets in Africa, including recent and relevant financial experience and expertise gained through various corporate and professional appointments over the years.

Detailed biographies of our committee members are on pages 88-91 of this Annual Report. Our company secretary is secretary to this committee.

## Meetings during the year

Our scheduled quarterly meetings take place shortly before Board meetings. Before that, the committee has a pre-meeting to focus on Internal Audit and discuss any issues needing more time. We held five scheduled meetings and four combined Internal Assurance and pre-meetings during the year. Attendance during the year is set out on page 105.

We also met three times between the end of the financial year and the signing of this Annual Report.

The Committee Chair also invites other regular attendees including the CEO, CFO, deputy CFO, Chief internal auditor and Chief Compliance and Risk officer, along with internal audit partners (EY) and other senior executives.

Representatives of our external auditor, Deloitte, were invited and attended all meetings. Akhil Gupta also attends our committee meetings as an appointed observer on behalf of Bharti Airtel.

Other senior finance and ExCo leaders sometimes attend and present to our committee if specialist knowledge is required.

## Audit and Risk Committee report continued

The committee chair meets privately and separately with each of the Group CFO, chief internal auditor, chief compliance officer, and our external auditor to ensure the effective flow of material information between the committee and management. We also regularly make time for discussion at the end of meetings without management present.

quality of relationships and communications, and review and oversight of key areas of responsibility were all considered effective, with all feedback very positive. In terms of the areas identified for focus in last year's evaluation, there were improved ratings for the committee's oversight of risk and the effectiveness of its assessment of internal controls.

## Effectiveness

## Part 1

## Our work during the year

At each quarterly meeting, we review summary reports from the Internal Assurance function, as well as financial results and details of actions taken or proposed plans. We also receive summary reports from our external auditors at the half year and year end. Our committee chair then reports to the Board on our activities, recommendations and other relevant matters.

Weendorsed the approach outlined and framework and methodology being adopted. Financing andforeign currency risk review: wediscussed: • Exchange rate volatility and devaluation risk • The financial reporting implications resulting from the Nigerian naira and Malawian kwacha devaluation • Liquidity and refinancing risk • The depth of market and newproducts, banking landscape and treasury governance • Related internal controls and compliance Wediscussed mitigation strategies for the devaluation of local currencies against the USdollar in the medium/long term. Wecontinued to oversee the rebalancing of debt from Group level to OpColevel. AirtelMoneyCommerceB.V.(AMCBV): wediscussed in detail our responsibilities for overseeing the AMCBVbusiness, particularly given the separation activities and the desire to avoid any unnecessary duplication of effort with the AMCBVBoard. Weanalysed the current Airtel Money risk and compliance structure and systems to assess their fitness for purpose. Our senior independent director attended the AMCBVAudit and Risk Committee as a member of the Audit and Risk Committee on Airtel Africa's behalf to provide oversight. Wereviewed the register of significant risks and assessed the regulatory-related implications of a breach. Wereviewed back-end controls and supported actions to strengthen KYC and minimise commission arbitrage. IT operations - risk governance andresilience: wereviewed the risk of technology obsolescence and examined our network resilience and business continuity plans. Weundertook a detailed review of the security environment. The chief information security officer (CISO) provided regular updates to our committee on ongoing security projects. Culture: wereviewed and approved a risk culture framework. This is being implemented by a joint team of the enterprise Risk and Internal Audit teams supported by HR. Our committee also | For details of our principal and emerging risks, see pages 75-79 |

Wecontinued the process of self-certification by business units to support the rigour of the internal audit and external audit assurance process. This places accountability for assurance on operational staff. Wealso continued to review overall ratings on the quality of processes and controls identified for each OpCo, alongside a rating of end-to-end processes across all OpCos. Continuous Control Monitoring (CCM): the results of the proof of concept for the continuous controls monitoring initiative were presented to the committee during the year and the initiative was deemedsuccessful.

| Supporting the Group's sustainability strategy | Airtel Africa is a memberofthe JAC, an association of telecoms operators aiming to verify, assess and develop corporate social responsibility implementation across the manufacturing centres of suppliers. Membership of the JAC allows us to conduct ESG audits more cost-effectively through cost sharing with other global telecoms companies. During the reporting period, Airtel Africa completed five audits at vendor facilities and will complete a similar number annually. Corrective actions for the issues raised in these audits will be monitored by the Internal Audit team and validated when completed by the vendors. Wealso reviewed the issues presented in audits carried out by otherJACmembersand considered these as part of the overall ESG risk profile for our vendors. | See pages 63-64 for our climate-change risk disclosures |

## Ongoing financial reporting activities

We reviewed the integrity of the quarterly, half year and full year financial statements. We also examined other statements containing financial information, including trading updates and investor presentations and packs, and recommended their approval to the Board. At each of our meetings, we reviewed and constructively challenged the accounting methodologies, key estimates, and judgements and disclosures set out in the papers prepared by management - determining the appropriateness of these with input from the external auditor. Key transactions, judgements and estimates in relation to this year's financial statements are listed on page 133. We also reviewed existing and emerging litigation and regulatory risks.

## Reviewing the Annual Report 2024

At the request of the Board, we reviewed this Annual Report to consider whether, taken as a whole, it was fair, balanced and understandable. We have robust governance processes in place to support the year end review of the Annual Report, including ensuring that everyone involved understands the 'fair, balanced and understandable' requirements. Our considerations included:

## Fairness and balance

-  Is the Annual Report open, honest and accurate? Are we reporting on our weaknesses, difficulties and challenges alongside our successes and opportunities?
-  Do we clearly explain our KPIs and is there strong linkage between our KPIs and our strategy?
-  Is there a fair balance between AMPs and reported figures?
-  Do we show our progress over time and is there consistency in our metrics and measurements?
-  Does the narrative and analysis in the report and accounts effectively balance the needs and interests of our key stakeholder groups?

## Understandable

-  Do we explain our business model, strategy and accounting policies in a simple way, using precise and clear language?
-  Do we break up lengthy narrative with quotes, tables, case studies and graphics?
-  Do we define industry terminology and acronyms?
-  Do we have a consistent tone across the Annual Report?
-  Are we clearly 'signposting' to where more information can be found?

Iterations of the draft Annual Report were provided to committee members throughout the production process. Following our formal review in meetings on 26 April, 2 May and 7 May, we confirmed to the Board that this Annual Report is fair and balanced and provides enough clarity for shareholders to understand our business model, strategy, position and performance. The directors then made their assessment following the Board's review of the document at its meetings on 28 March, 7 May and 8 May 2024.

## Part 1 continued

## Governance

At each quarterly meeting, we receive and review summary reports with updates on upcoming proposals and regulations to UK corporate reporting. The FRC publishes thematic reviews and other guidance to help improve the quality of corporate reporting. We also receive summarised reports from our external auditors highlighting any proposed amendments to UK corporate reporting.

## Part 2

## Accounting and financial reporting issues and our response

We considered the following accounting and financial reporting issues, judgements and estimates in the context of the financial statements and management override of controls and fraud, discussed them with our external auditor, and have found the response to each appropriate and acceptable.

| Significant issue                               | Howthis was addressed by our committee                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Going concern and long-term viability statement | As we advise the Board on the form and basis of conclusion for the long-term viability statement and going concern assessment, wereviewed these in depth alongside the Group's strategy and business model. Our review covered: • The Group's prospects • The period under consideration • Principal risks (see pages 75-79) • Longer-term cash flow forecasts • The sensitivities considered in management's stress-test to respond to the principal risks Taking into account potential mitigating actions, we were satisfied with the conclusion and disclosure on the Group's long-term viability and going concern. Our 2023/24 long-term viability statement and more details on the assessment is set out on page 80. More details about going concern assessment are on page 187. |

| The treatment of Nigerian and Malawian currency devaluations as exceptional items | In June 2023, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) announced changes to the operations in the Nigerian Foreign Exchange Market. This included abolishing segmentation, with all segments nowcollapsing into the Investors and Exporters (I&E) window and the reintroduction of the 'Willing Buyer, Willing Seller' model at this window. As a result of this decision, the US dollar appreciated against the Nigerian naira by 38%in the month of June 2023 where the exchange rate moved to 756 naira per US dollar as against the opening rate of 465 naira per US dollar. |
|                                                                                   | The after-effects of the CBNannouncement continued to impact the exchange rate materially during January 2024 when the Nigerian naira to the US dollar moved to 1,414 per US dollar which was also above the threshold percentage as per Group's exceptional item policy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|                                                                                   | In addition, in November 2023, the Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM) also announced structural changes to the foreign exchange market with its decision to adjust the exchange rate from selling rate of MWK1,180 to a selling rate of MWK1,700 to the US dollar with effect from 9 November 2023. As part of the structural changes, the RBMstarted authorising dealer banks to freely negotiate exchange rates to trade with their clients and among themselves, notwithstanding any limitations previously in place.                                                        |
|                                                                                   | The committee considered and was satisfied that these changes announced by CBNin Nigeria and RBMin Malawi led to a material impact on the Group financial statements in line with the Group's policy on exceptional items and alternative performance measures. The Nigerian naira's impact for the months of June 2023, and January to March 2024, and the Malawian kwacha's impact for the month of November 2023 were, therefore, presented as exceptional items.                                                                                                      |
|                                                                                   | Further, the committee also considered and deemed appropriate the application of the critical judgement on whether the foreign exchange losses meet the Group's policy as exceptional and whether the foreign exchange losses are of a size, nature and incidence that their exclusion is considered necessary to explain the underlying performance of the Group and to improve the comparability between periods.                                                                                                                                                       |
| Review of tax/legal/regulatory matters                                            | Wereviewed the key developments in material tax, legal and regulatory cases during the period, management's estimate of key tax, legal and regulatory disputes, and howthese were rated as probable, possible or remote.We were satisfied with the accounting conclusions reached by management and the disclosures within the financial statements and the related disclosure as a key source of estimation uncertainty.                                                                                                                                                 |
| Goodwill impairment                                                               | Our committee received and discussed a management paper on impairment and challenged the appropriateness of the key assumptions and judgements adopted for the annual impairment testing exercise in December 2023. Weconsidered the level of operating cash flow forecasts, resulting headroom and reviewed the sensitivities performed by management on key assumptions such as the discount rate, growth rates and the headroom if a five-year plan were adopted with appropriate long-term growth rates.                                                              |
| Alternative performance measures (APMs)                                           | The Group added 'Earnings per share before exceptional items and derivative and foreign exchange losses' as a newAPMduringthe year. The committee performed a detailed review on the use of APMswithin the Annual Report (including reconciliations disclosed) and concluded that the balance and equal prominenceofAPMs (in comparison to GAAPmeasures) was appropriate. For more information on APMs, refer to page 244                                                                                                                                                 |

## Part 3

## Risk management and internal controls

## Our approach to risk

As highlighted in the strategy and risk sections of the strategic report, risk management is inherent to our management thinking and business-planning processes. The Board has overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining our risk management and internal control systems.

For more information on our risks and mitigation and our risk management framework, see the risk report on pages 72-74.

The Board also approved the statement of the principal risks and uncertainties set out on pages 75-79.

## Progress in 2023/24

Each quarter, our CEO and CFO provide a compliance certificate connected to the preparation of our financial results. This includes the policies and procedures for areas of the business under their responsibility and confirms the existence of adequate internal control systems throughout the year. Our committee reviews any exceptions noted in this exercise.

The key features of our internal control system, which assures the accuracy and reliability of our financial reporting, are listed on page 135.

## Working to minimise the risk of fraud, bribery and corruption

Minimising the risk of fraud is one of the key priorities for internal audit, and we do this in a range of ways. These include assessing the quality of balance sheet reconciliations, key judgement matters, tenders and quotations, and controls over payments and associated applications.

## Part 3 continued

The committee received and reviewed reports of attempted and actual fraud incidents during the year. We received comprehensive updates from management on the incidents and reviewed the root cause analysis and remediation plans to address gaps noted. The committee will continue to monitor the implementation of these plans across all markets, through management updates followed by verification from the internal audit team.

We continue to focus on limiting our potential exposure to bribery and corruption risks, for example by providing mandatory training, reviewing financial records and developing our policies and procedures. Our contract management system includes mandatory certification to our Code of Conduct and anti-bribery and corruption policy. Each year, every employee must take part in computer-based training on anti-bribery and corruption and our Code of Conduct. Our internal audit team reviews our anti-bribery compliance programme to assess its continued effectiveness. We will continue to assess bribery risks in our markets to refine and improve our anti-bribery compliance programme.

Our committee also monitors and oversees procedures around allegations of improper behaviour and employee complaints.

## Whistleblowing procedures

Our whistleblowing programme is a confidential channel through which employees can report unethical practices or wrongdoing. We have an independent whistleblowing process managed by an external professional services firm from its centre of excellence in South Africa.

Throughout the reporting period, we received updates on the volume of reports, key themes emerging from these reports and the results of related investigations. We assess the reports for the category and level of concern and consider these in line with a protocol for review, investigation, action, closure and feedback. This is done independent of management where necessary and involving senior business unit or HR management as appropriate.

We continue to monitor the volume, geographic distribution and range of reports made to the hotline to understand key themes, the results of investigations undertaken, significant regional compliance concerns, and whether access to this facility is less understood or publicised in some countries.

During the 12 months ended 31 March 2024, we investigated 67 incidents received through various touch points and our formal whistleblowing channels. These were of varying magnitude, with 11 above the ExCo threshold - these and the measures taken in response have been reported to our committee. Of these 56 cases, 84% have been closed. The very small number of reports that contained allegations of a breach of our Code of Conduct were thoroughly investigated and disciplinary action was taken where appropriate.

The majority of reports received during the period were human resource issues that indicated no compliance concerns or serious breaches of our Code of Conduct.

Our committee chair reports to the Board at each of its meetings on the operation of our Code of Conduct, and anti-bribery, corruption and whistleblowing procedures. This report contains enough detail to enable the Board to oversee these areas and make sure arrangements are in place for a proportionate and independent investigation of related matters and for follow-up action.

## Internal audit

The internal audit team provides independent and objective assurance over the design and operating effectiveness of the Group's system of internal control. Our internal audit team considers compliance with internal policies, regulatory obligations and fraud risk mitigation as part of its independent testing and evaluation. The team is composed of individuals at the Group office and in the operating markets. This enables access to specialist skills and ensures local knowledge and experience for more effective coverage.

Airtel Africa has also adopted an internal audit co-sourcing model, where the internal audit activity is supplemented through a partnership with EY as the internal audit service partner. This ensures access to additional specialist skills and an extended knowledge base. The team is governed by the internal audit charter, as approved by the Audit and Risk Committee, and is headed by our chief internal auditor who reports to the committee and the Group CEO. The committee chair regularly meets with the chief internal auditor to discuss the team's activity and any significant issues arising from its work.

The committee approves the annual audit plan in the first meeting of each financial year. We then receive quarterly updates on activities and progress against the plan. During the year, internal audit focused on principal risks as well as emerging key risks, including regulatory compliance, cybersecurity and network resilience.

All key findings and the corresponding mitigation plan from management are reported quarterly to our committee. We focus more on unsatisfactory audit results and conduct an in-depth review with risk owners to gain a comprehensive view of how management will address the findings. Internal audit monitors the implementation of all action plans and validates this once completed by management.

Key controls: the key controls programme continues to evolve and has been fully implemented across all markets and business lines. During the year, a control-optimising project was launched to make sure focus on high-risk processes was maintained, including revisions to include additional high-risk processes. The committee continues to monitor this programme through half-yearly validation of testing results presented by the internal audit team.

The next phase for this programme is to review the possibility of automation for efficiency and consistency of the validation testing effort.

Automation: the internal audit function continues to invest in several initiatives to improve its effectiveness, particularly in the adoption of new technologies. The continuous controls monitoring pilot was successful and this is now being developed as a key programme for internal audit, to be rolled out across all markets and business lines. In addition, the internal audit analytics team has established a training programme for all team members to increase capabilities and audit execution and enhance the auditing process.

In evaluating the work, effectiveness and independence of internal audit, our committee drew its own conclusion based on our experience and regular contact with the chief internal auditor and our internal audit partners. We will conduct an externally facilitated review next year as part of our annual evaluation. The committee also reviewed the annual internal audit work plan, received periodic reports on the results of the internal audit work, and monitored management's responsiveness to the internal auditor's findings and recommendations.

## Audit and Risk Committee report continued

## Part 4

## External auditors

## Engaging our auditor

Our committee manages the Group's relationship with the external auditor. Each year, we assess their performance, effectiveness and independence and recommend their reappointment or removal to the Board.

The Group's external auditor is Deloitte, and the lead partner is Ryan Duffy.

## Effectiveness of the external audit process

Our committee makes recommendations to the Board on whether to reappoint the external auditor, their independence from our business, and the scope and fee for the audit. After reviewing and challenging the work done by Deloitte during the year, we approved its terms of engagement and are fully satisfied with its performance, objectivity, quality of challenge and independence.

We recommended to the Board that they be reappointed as our external auditor for the 2025 financial year. The Board will recommend this to shareholders as resolution 15 at our 2024 AGM.

Our committee works in line with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the FRC Guidance on Audit Committees and EU regulations on audit reform for our external audit tendering timetable.

We will continue to follow the annual appointment process until our next competitive tender. In line with current regulations, our next mandatory tender will be in readiness to retain our current auditor or move to a new audit firm for the 2029 financial year. This timetable is subject to an annual assessment of Deloitte's effectiveness and independence. The audit was last subjected to a tender in 2019 when Deloitte was appointed.

Our choice of auditor is not restricted by contractual obligations or a minimum appointment period. We've complied with the provisions of the Competition and Markets Authority's Order for this financial year relating to audit rotation and tendering and the provision of non-audit services.

## Working with our auditor

The lead external audit partner and his team attend our committee meetings to provide insight and challenge and to report on their review of the half year results and audit of the year end financial statements. To facilitate open dialogue and assurance, we also hold private sessions with our auditor without management present. Our committee chair regularly meets with Deloitte outside scheduled committee meetings.

A number of external audit teams are involved in the audit, given the need to report both our own financial results and to report to our parent company, Bharti Airtel.

Throughout the year, audit teams deliver:

1.    A half year review report on Airtel Africa's interim condensed consolidated financial statements by Deloitte UK
2.    The audit report on Airtel Africa's consolidated and company-only financial statements signed by Deloitte UK
3.    Local statutory accounts audited by each Deloitte Africa team, with some work performed by Deloitte India

During its half year and full year results reporting, Deloitte did not report any significant deficiencies in controls or issues with our accounting judgements and estimates.

Our committee receives a detailed audit plan from Deloitte identifying key risks and areas of focus. We review and challenge this external audit plan, including audit scope and materiality, to make sure Deloitte has identified all key risks and developed robust audit procedures and communication plans. We also look at the quality of auditors' reports throughout the year and consider responses to accounting, financial control and audit issues as they arise.

During the year, Deloitte visited the top seven OpCos, as well as the shared service centre in India and the Group finance team in Dubai.

## Using our auditor for non-audit services

We safeguard auditor independence and objectivity through a number of control measures, including limiting the nature and value of non-audit services performed by the external auditor.

Bearing in mind the need for relationships with other audit firms, where we consider our external auditor to have the most appropriate skills, expertise and safeguards, we may use them for certain acceptable non-audit services. We will only do so in line with law or regulation or where there are significant efficiencies to be had when this is done in combination with the audit. Their knowledge of our business may make such services more cost effective and ensure confidentiality.

Our non-audit services policy sets out the circumstances in which the external auditor can provide non-audit services to the Group. It restricts the provision of non-audit services to those allowable under the FRC Revised Ethical Standard 2019 and provides a monetary threshold to management for pre-approved limit.

Under our policy, the committee has delegated to the CEO and CFO have authority to approve permitted non-audit services up to $50,000, with any amounts above this needing committee approval. Our committee reviews and approves any non-audit services with fees above the monetary threshold or not stipulated by the non-audit services policy.

Our review of the auditor's performance during the reporting period included non-audit services and the ability of Deloitte to maintain independence while providing these services.

Non-audit services work for the financial year included:

1.    Half year review work for our company
2.    Non-statutory audit of Airtel Mobile Commerce B.V. financial statements
3.  Control attestation in Zambia required by local regulations
4.    Certification of Smartcash Payment Services Bank Limited's customers' deposits required by local regulations in Nigeria
5.    Mobile Money regulatory reporting required by local regulations in Uganda
6.    ESG assurance and UK Single Electronic Format (UKSEF) ESEF assurance

The value of this was $2.2m, representing approximately 31% of Deloitte's total remuneration as set out in note 8.1 to the consolidated financial statements on page 201.

## Part 5

## Finance Committee

Our Finance Committee is an operational management committee overseen by our committee. Its two independent non-executive director members are also members of the Audit and Risk Committee.

Given the complexity and importance of finance, treasury and tax policy matters, the Board has delegated oversight and governance to this specialist Finance Committee. This has strengthened our adherence to the relationship agreement and treasury and tax controls. This committee frames our finance policies and procedures, creating risk framework mechanisms for treasury and tax to help achieve our strategic financial goals with a balance of initiative and risk control.

## Committee duties

-  Ensures our treasury activities are carried out within an agreed policy framework
-  Makes sure activities are within agreed levels of risk and will contribute to our financial performance through focused management
-  Makes sure operations are appropriately funded and conducted in line with policy
-  Ensures the overall treasury objective and specific objectives for each main treasury activity are consistent with both financial and corporate business objectives
-  Recommends the strategic tax policy for approval by the Board
-  Ensures adequate liquidity to meet financial obligations based on cash flow forecasts
-  Optimises the interest cost on gross debt within prudent risk parameters
-  Determines and approves the derivatives policy on swaps, FX and interest-rate hedges
-  Generates reasonable commercial returns on investments to protect investment capital and ensure desired liquidity
-  Minimises the adverse impact of FX movements associated with transactions and our operating exposure in various currencies due to multinational operations
-  Maintains diversified access to various local and global debt and borrowings markets
-  Determines and approves our strategic tax planning policies
-  Approves new debt and the cancellation and modification of borrowing and debt facilities

## Committee members

Members were appointed by the Board on the recommendation of the Nominations Committee in consultation with the Audit and Risk Committee chair. They are Jaideep Paul, CFO, as chair; CEO Segun Ogunsanya; deputy CFO Kamal Dua; and two independent nonexecutive directors, Ravi Rajagopal and Annika Poutiainen. We review the composition of the committee and the continued participation of independent non-executive directors each year.

## Chair's statement

I'm pleased to present the Nominations Committee report for 2023/24 and to share our plans for the coming year. This year was a busy one for our committee, with several changes to our Board and leadership team. Let me summarise the main issues that occupied our time.

## Succession planning

Our committee oversees succession planning for the Board and the senior leadership team. We make sure our Board members have the necessary drive, abilities, experience and diversity to lead Airtel Africa in delivering on our strategy.

We also monitor succession planning for senior management directly below the Board to ensure leadership continuity and a strong pipeline of diverse talent for progression to Board level. We work to support and encourage a growing pool of people potentially suitable for senior roles at Airtel Africa. This year, we looked at our people capability and talent pipeline with a particular focus on gender and underperforming OpCos.

## Changes to the Board

This year has seen some significant changes to the composition of the Board.

We announced in January 2024 that Sunil Taldar, director of transformation, will succeed Segun Ogunsanya as managing director and CEO after Segun's retirement. Sunil will join the Board as an executive director and formally take the role of CEO on 1 July 2024.

We're delighted to welcome Sunil as our next CEO. He's shown significant drive and energy in turning around our India business by focusing on network modernisation, distribution and operational efficiency.

As mentioned in my introduction to the governance report, I'm also delighted that Segun has agreed to become our Charitable Foundation's inaugural chair. The Charitable Foundation will accelerate our sustainability initiatives and corporate social responsibility efforts across Africa. After retiring from Airtel Africa, Segun will also be available for 12 months to advise our chair, Board and CEO.

I'd also like to recognise the contributions of two Board members who stepped down this year, Doug Baillie and Kelly Bayer Rosmarin. Doug served on the Board for nearly five years as an independent director and chair of our Remuneration Committee. After serving as director for two years, Kelly stepped down in October 2023 to focus on other business interests. John Danilovich has also informed the Board of his intention to retire as independent non-executive director of Airtel Africa at the end this year's AGM in July 2024. Paul Arkwright joins the Board on 9 May 2024.

On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Doug, Kelly and John for their immense contribution to our success in building Airtel Africa into a market-leading mobile service and mobile money provider. I wish them all the best for the future.

After implementing these changes, our committee focused on planning for the transition of our longstanding non-executive directors who were all appointed in 2019 at the time of IPO. Our priority is to ensure the Board remains well balanced with a strong pipeline of candidates with the appropriate skills, experience and capabilities.

We reviewed the tenure of all directors and discussed future Board rotation as part of our ongoing review of the Board's current and future needs.

As you can see from their biographies on pages 88-91, our committee chairs and members have recent and relevant skills, experience and expertise.

## Changes to the senior leadership team

2023/24 saw a further strengthening of our ExCo with significant appointments:

-  The appointment of Oliver Fortuin as the CEO for Airtel Business (June 2023)
-  The appointment of Martin P. Fréchette as chief legal officer (June 2023)
-  The appointment of Anwar Soussa as regional director, Francophone Africa (August 2023)
-  The appointment of Jacques Barkhuizen as chief information officer (October 2023)
-  The appointment of Sunil Taldar as director of transformation (October 2023) and CEO designate (January 2024)

We also made some significant senior leadership appointments, welcoming Kamal Dua, deputy chief finance officer and Oladimeji Olaniyan, head of strategy and sustainability, to our senior management team.

Our work to identify high-potential executives and to encourage their development led to several key internal promotions in and across our OpCos this year. We continue to prioritise gender balance at all recruitment levels and, in February 2024, we appointed our first woman MD in Madagascar. Some 43.2% of all our senior appointments (senior manager and above) were women in the last half year.

Meanwhile, 28.5% of our OpCo ExCo members are women, excluding MDs, 21.1% of our senior managers are women, and 27.8% of employees across the business are women. Our employee base consists of 43 nationalities.

## Engaging with our people

Our people are our greatest asset, and finding and holding on to top talent in a highly competitive global market is a priority for the Board and management. This year, our CEO voiced concerns over the growing challenge of retaining key people in our largest markets. In Nigeria, for example, we saw top performers leaving for other countries such as Canada, Ireland and the UK, and valued people lost to competitors. We acted against this by creating various incentives beyond cash to attract top performers, including Airtel Africa mobility and 'Women for technology' programmes. We've also introduced revised salary structures and retention packages, and improved allowances payable. Initiatives such as these are also helping us in our work to close the gender gap in all of our locations.

As the non-executive director with responsibility for engaging with our employees, I was delighted to join several employee events during the year to hear directly from our people and respond to their questions. This included the leadership conclave in March 2024, when I met with over 200 colleagues. I shared feedback from this event with the Board. All our independent non-executive directors are invited to quarterly all-employee town halls where they can take questions directly from colleagues.

For more information about our employee engagement, see pages 115-119

## Evaluating our Board

As part of our corporate governance review each year, we examine the independence and diversity of our Board and the balance of skills and development needs of its members.

We regularly map the skill sets of our Board members against our strategy and annual operating plan. This year, we confirmed that, collectively, our non-executive directors have significant experience across the critical areas of strategy, risk management, M&amp;A, technology, media and telecoms (TMT) and Africa.

As part of our committee's governance oversight role, we support the Board when it considers conflicts of interest and independence issues. When reviewing conflict authorisations, we look at other appointments held by the director as well as the findings of the Board evaluation. Following the review, our committee determined that all non-executive directors continued to demonstrate independence; the Board agreed with our conclusion.

In line with the 2018 Code, all directors will retire at this year's AGM and, except for John Danilovich, put themselves up for reappointment (appointment in the case of Sunil Taldar and Paul Arkwright) by shareholders. Each of our non-executive directors seeking appointment or reappointment are independent in judgement and character.

Finally, in this busy year for our committee, we also paid significant attention to enhancing the effectiveness of the Board and its committees. We held an internally facilitated Board effectiveness evaluation, which concluded that the Board continues to operate effectively with an opportunity to improve in minor areas.

We're privileged to have a Board with a diversity of skills and international experience to perform their vital role. This is invaluable in developing our business strategy and enhancing our governance capabilities.

Airtel Africa is a multicultural business, and our ethnic diversity is reflected in our Board, leadership team and employees. We remain committed to ensuring diversity in terms of culture, age, gender, ethnicity, length of service and educational background - and will continue to build an inclusive and diverse workplace.

I welcome questions from shareholders on our committee's activities. To discuss any aspect of this report please contact me through our company secretary, Simon O'Hara (see page 254 for contact details). I'll also be attending our 2024 AGM and look forward to the opportunity to meet you and answer your questions there.

## Nominations Committee report continued

## About the committee

Led by the chair of our Board, our committee consists of independent non-executive directors. Our CEO and chief HR officer are also invited to attend committee meetings and submit reports.

We met formally three times during the 2023/24 financial year. Our focus, driven by a more ambitious strategic agenda and the planned separation of Airtel Money, was on longer-term succession planning for the senior executive team, short-term senior leadership changes, and supporting the CEO on his proposal to restructure our ExCo. Improving the gender balance at senior leadership level across our business, including in our HQ and OpCos, remained fundamentally important.

Having reviewed the composition and performance of the Board and its committees, we believe our Board has the experience, expertise and appetite for challenge to take Airtel Africa forward in line with our strategy while maintaining good governance. We keep this under regular review.

## Nominations Committee report continued

## Developing our Board

One of our priorities is to continually develop our Board members. We inform directors about relevant seminars and training and encourage and support their attendance. We provide regulatory updates at each Board meeting, and specialist advisors brief our committees on topics such as changes to accounting procedures and UK corporate governance. Our Board undertook a series of development activities during the reporting period, including training by our corporate legal advisors Herbert Smith Freehills LLP on the political environment, governance reform, liability to investors and directors' duties.

We reviewed the induction programme for directors and concluded that this is appropriate.

## Board and committee balance, diversity, independence and effectiveness

The chair of the Board is responsible for making sure independent non-executive directors can constructively challenge executive directors, while supporting them to implement our strategy and run the business effectively. He works with our committee to make sure the Board has the right blend of skills, independence and knowledge.

## Appointing and re-electing directors

## Our appointment processes

The Board has the power to appoint new directors and to fill any vacancy. When recruiting members for the Board, our committee adopts a formal and transparent procedure - this considers the skills, knowledge and level of experience required, as well as diversity.

We begin by evaluating the balance of skills, knowledge and experience of existing Board members, the diversity of the Board, and the ongoing requirements and strategic developments of the business. This enables us to focus on appointing someone who will complement and enhance the Board's effectiveness and overall performance.

We review a longlist of globally drawn potential candidates and shortlist candidates for interview based on the criteria set out in the agreed specification. These include the requirements of the Group, the diversity of the Board, and the skills, knowledge and experience of current members. Non-executive appointees must show they have adequate time available for the role, and, before being appointed, all candidates must identify any potential conflicts of interest.

Shortlisted candidates are interviewed by the committee chair, other committee members and the CEO. The committee then recommends the preferred candidate, who is invited to meet other Board members. Finally, the committee takes up detailed external references before making a formal recommendation to the Board for appointment.

No director took on a significant new appointment during the year. Before accepting any appointment, each director is expected to discuss the anticipated time commitment with our chair and company secretary to make sure they continue to have adequate time for Airtel Africa Board duties.

## Re-election

All directors will stand for re-election at each year's AGM while in office. Each director proposed for re-election at our AGM has been unanimously recommended by other members of the Board.

## Effectiveness

The internal Board evaluation reviewed our committee's effectiveness and sought feedback from the committee members. The composition and management of Nominations Committee meetings and quality of information provided continued to be highly rated. The management of director succession was seen as operating effectively, with the appointment of the CEO designate and the Remuneration Committee chair. In terms of the areas identified for focus in last year's evaluation, there is still work to be done to achieve better gender balance at ExCo level, although significant progress is being made in our OpCos.

- For progress on employee gender balance, see page 145

Succession planning for the executive directors, talent management and people oversight were identified as areas of strength. A greater focus on the executive team and the quality of talent in key OpCos were identified as areas to work on.

We discussed the output of the evaluation, which concluded that we continued to operate effectively throughout the year and confirmed our intended areas of focus for the year ahead.

| 2023/24 evaluation    | Outcome        | Keythemesand areas for focus                                    | Action                                                                                                                        |

| Nominations Committee | Areas of focus | Executive gender balance                                        | To continue to focus on our Board and executive succession planning to achieve gender balance at all senior leadership levels |

Areas of challenge are identified throughout this report. Each director goes through a performance review process as part of the annual Board effectiveness review. This confirmed that each director continues to make an effective contribution to the Board.

## Advice available to the Board

All directors have access to the advice and services of the company secretary. Directors may also take independent professional advice at our expense where this is judged necessary to fulfil their responsibilities. During the year, the Board took advice from:

-  Alvarez &amp; Marsal through the Remuneration Committee, as explained in more detail on pages 146-165
-  Our corporate legal advisors Herbert Smith Freehills LLP through the Market Disclosure Committee on the identification of insider information
-  Legal advisors Clifford Chance on share plan and remuneration policy matters
-  Our brokers on the sector and relative performance of our share price

## Employee engagement

- For details on how we engage with our employees, see page 115

## Diversity

Our policy is to promote and appoint the best person for each role without regard to age, ethnicity or disability - only considering factors such as educational and professional backgrounds as appropriate for the position. This applies to the entire business, including the Board. We're working to build diversity and inclusion into our appointment and promotion processes at every level. All Airtel Africa employees have completed our annual Code of Conduct training and certification, which covers our commitments on diversity, inclusion and non-discrimination.

## Board diversity

We see diversity as fundamental to the successful operation of our Board and to creating a balanced culture across our business.

The Board represents a broad range of skills, experience, age, education, social background, ethnicity, gender and nationality. Our youngest director is 35, and the Group is ethnically diverse. Most have spent a considerable amount of time living outside the UK, and this range of experience is invaluable in developing our business strategy and enhancing our governance capabilities.

The Board regularly reviews its balance and composition. Board diversity is supported by the Board diversity policy which specifically applies to the Board and its committees and supports the Group's wider approach to diversity. This policy was reviewed and approved during the year. The diversity of the Board's principal committees reflects the diversity of the non-executive directors.

The Board supports the FTSE Women Leaders Review target of 40% female representation on the Board and senior leadership team by 2025. The definition of senior leadership team includes members of the ExCo and their direct reports. We recognise that we need to bring more women on to both our Board and senior leadership team - and our committee considered how to achieve compliance. We're addressing the gender balance challenge across our OpCos by championing initiatives that support diverse talent and thought. These critical enablers of sustainable growth include the Airtel Africa mobility programme, the 'Women for technology' programme and the Airtel Academy.

For more information about these initiatives, see page 117

We also appointed our first woman operating country (OpCo) managing director: Anne Tchokonte joined as managing director of Airtel Madagascar in February 2024.

## Our Board diversity and inclusion policy

Our Board diversity policy sets out our approach to diversity and is applicable to the Board and its committees (specifically, the Audit and Risk Committee, Remuneration Committee and Nominations Committee). It also supports our wider approach to diversity across the business. This is governed in greater detail by our Code of Conduct which applies to all employees, agency workers, self-employed contractors, casual workers, operatives and job applicants.

This year, our committee also considered how to achieve compliance with the Listing Rule disclosure requirement that states that at least one woman should be appointed as chair or senior independent director either on the Board or as CEO or finance director by the end of 2025. As at 31 March 2024, 27% of the directors were women and there were no women in senior Board positions. The Board is not currently compliant with these two Listing Rule targets.

While we haven't yet achieved the FTSE Women Leaders Review's Board-level gender-balance target, doing so is an integral part of our succession planning. The gender balance of our Group ExCo is still a challenge, and we're working to bring more women into the committee by 2026. We're making good progress in addressing the gender imbalance at our OpCo ExCo level and in our senior management teams who report to the ExCo.

We make sure the specification for any new senior management role is equally suited to applicants of any gender and that there's no discrimination at any stage in the selection process based on applicant characteristics. Diversity and inclusion are, and will continue to be, a key focus for our business.

The Board fully supports the Parker Review's 'Beyond One by 21' recommendation and is pleased to confirm our compliance with the Listing Rule target of having at least one person on the Board from a minority ethnic background.

The change to the Board's gender and ethnic diversity compared to 31 March 2023 is because Doug Baillie and Kelly Bayer Rosmarin stepped down from the Board during the year.

This report sets out the remuneration policy for our directors, what they've been paid in the year and how this is linked to the performance achieved.

There are three sections to the report:

## Part 1

An introduction from the committee chair - this explains our approach to remuneration, summarises the key decisions made by the committee during the year (also part of the annual remuneration report), and gives an overview of our 2024/25 approach and policy.

## Part 2

The directors' remuneration policy - this sets out the remuneration policy for our CEO, CFO, chair and non-executive directors, which was approved by shareholders at the 2023 AGM and will remain in force until the 2026 AGM at the latest.

## Part 3

Our annual report on remuneration - this sets out in detail how we applied our current remuneration policy in 2023/24, the remuneration received by directors for the year and how the policy will be applied in 2024/25. This report will be put to an advisory shareholder vote at the AGM.

All amounts in this report are in US dollars ($), unless stated otherwise.

## Chair's introduction

I'm pleased to present the Remuneration Committee's report for 2023/24.

During the year, the key issues for the committee included determining the performance outcomes for our incentives, the remuneration arrangements for the new CEO, Sunil Taldar and the treatment of remuneration for the outgoing CEO, Segun Ogunsanya. All of these areas are discussed below.

## Performance outcomes for the year

To recap on the performance as described in the strategic report, this year Airtel Africa's continued investment into maintaining and modernising its 4G network whilst also expanding its distribution network helped continue the expansion of our customer base. This strong performance was reflected in revenue growth and expansion in the EBITDA margin when measured in constant currency.

The targets for our financial measures flow from our annual operating plan, which is an output of Airtel's investment decisions, each of which is approved taking into account the potential return on capital. The financial performance measures in our incentives are measured using constant currency as we have significant operations in a number of countries and this measurement basis helps reflect the underlying performance of the business over the performance period. It keeps management neutral to currency fluctuations which could improve or worsen reported currency financial measures.

Annual bonuses for 2023/24 were based on a scorecard of measures: net revenue (35%), EBITDA (35%), operating free cash flow (10%) and ESG and governance objectives (20%). Given the Group's strong performance with 21.1% growth in net revenue on a constant currency basis, 21.3% growth in underlying EBITDA and 34% growth in operating free cash flow, the targets for all of the financial objectives were either exceeded or close to the stretch target. Both of our executive directors in the year also had role-specific personal objectives for the year - see page 157 for details. As a result, the outgoing CEO's bonus outcome was at 95.9% of maximum and the CFO's bonus outcome was 98.1% of maximum. However, as set out below in the section on considering formulaic outcomes, the committee reviewed the overall performance of the company and exercised discretion to reduce the formulaic bonus outcomes to 85% of maximum for the outgoing CEO and 87% of the maximum for the CFO. One third of the bonus for the CEO and the CFO will be deferred into shares for two years.

Our outgoing CEO and our CFO were granted an LTIP award in 2021 which vested based on performance up to 31 March 2024. This award vested at 78.9% which reflects strong performance over the past 3-year period, with net revenue growth of 21.5% per annum in constant currency, TSR performance of 34% being above the upper quartile of the comparator group, and an increase in underlying EBITDA margin of 3.54% in constant currency. See page 159 for details.

## Considering formulaic outcomes

Our committee reviewed the formulaic outcomes against the bonus and LTIP targets. In particular, we considered whether the bonus and LTIP outcomes were appropriate in the context of the depreciation of the Naira which had a significant impact on reported currency revenue and EBITDA. Nigeria is our biggest market, and although the economic turbulence affected the reported performance, we were also mindful of management's achievements in developing a clear plan, focusing on reducing costs and reducing foreign currency liabilities, while continuing to grow our customer base in an increasingly competitive market. This is reflected in our performance in Nigeria where revenue and EBITDA have both exhibited strong growth in constant currency. Taking this into account, we determined that the incentives had operated as intended throughout the year and that they were

reflective of the underlying performance of the group and its positive outlook as we expect the devaluations to result in a healthier economy in the medium term. Nevertheless, we are aware of the impact on shareholders created by these circumstances, and, seeking to improve alignment between the incentive outcomes and the shareholders' experience, have decided to apply a discretionary reduction of around 11% to the annual bonus outcome for the outgoing CEO and CFO. After the application of this reduction, the annual bonus outcome of the outgoing CEO and CFO was reduced from 95.9% and 98.1% respectively to 85% and 87% of maximum respectively. In addition, in determining the vesting outcome for the outgoing CEO's 2022 and 2023 LTIP awards, the Committee did make a discretionary downwards adjustment of around 8% to reflect the potential uncertainty of the financial forecasts on which the performance assessments were based.

## Board changes

During the year, Segun Ogunsanya informed the Board of his intent to retire and the Board agreed that Sunil Taldar will be appointed CEO on 1 July 2024 after a transition period. On appointment, Sunil's base salary will be $760,000, which, although below the salary of the outgoing CEO, may be subject to above-workforce increases over the coming years, depending on his performance in role and the performance of the company. His benefits will be in line with those of other senior executives and he will not receive a pension. His incentive opportunities are at the same level (as a percentage of salary) as for the outgoing CEO. His target annual bonus for 2024/25 will be set at 75% of salary (maximum 150% of salary), with one third to be deferred into Airtel Africa shares for two years. His LTIP awards for 2024/25 comprise a PSP grant of 150% of salary and RSU grant of 50% of salary, at maximum. In addition to his normal annual variable compensation, Sunil Taldar will also participate in the special one-off incentive which was approved by shareholders at the 2023 AGM, and is designed to incentivise a succesful IPO of Airtel Money. No buyout or joining awards were granted. Leaver terms for Segun Ogunsanya are set out below.

## Treatment of remuneration for the outgoing CEO

In considering Segun Ogunsanya's leaver terms, our committee noted that he oversaw a period of strong growth and continued progress for Airtel. During his leadership, Airtel maintained its position as one of the fastest growing and most profitable telecoms operators in Africa.

We took this into account in determining how to apply the policy and treat his inflight share awards on retirement, and decided that he should be treated as a good leaver. We also took into account when applying a pro rata reduction to his LTIP awards that his relationship with Airtel will continue from his retirement until 30 June 2025, during which time he will provide advisory services to the Chairman and the Airtel Africa Board, and chair the Airtel Africa Charitable Foundation.

In more detail, all elements of his CEO remuneration package will be paid up to his departure, at which point they will all cease. He will receive a pro-rated bonus for time served subject to his individual performance and the company's financial outlook which will be paid entirely in cash. He will not be eligible for the normal annual LTIP grant to be made in 2024. In light of the considerations noted above, we will exercise discretion to treat him as a good leaver under our share plans. This will result in his outstanding deferred bonus shares vesting in full. In addition, the number of shares under his outstanding LTIP awards will be reduced as a result of the pro-rating up to 30 June 2025 when his relationship with Airtel will end (in the case of the 2023 LTIP awards), and as a result of the application of the performance conditions for both the 2022 and 2023 LTIP awards. Awards will vest when he steps down as CEO and will be subject to malus and clawback. The post-vesting holding periods will be waived on his LTIP awards, but he will be required to hold shares to the value of 125% of base salary for at least two years in accordance with the post-cessation holding requirement. Segun Ogunsanya will also receive an amount for untaken holiday and an amount required to be paid under Dubai employment law. Further detail on the treatment of his LTIP awards is provided later in the report.

Finally, the Committee decided not to grant the one-off Airtel Money incentive award to Segun Ogunsanya for which he was eligible during FY 2023/24 as discussions regarding his potential retirement had already started at the intended date of grant.

## Implementation of policy in 2024/25

The salary for the CFO will be increased by 5% which is below the planned increase for employees which is slightly above 7%. No increase will be applied to the outgoing CEO's salary.

Maximum bonus opportunity is capped at 200% of base salary for the new CEO, and 175% of base salary for the CFO, under the policy approved by shareholders at the 2023 AGM. The actual 2024/25 bonus opportunities for the executive directors will again be set below these policy maximum levels. The 2024/25 max bonus will be set at 150% of base salary for the new CEO and 140% of salary for the CFO. In line with the policy, one third of any bonus will be deferred into shares for two years. It is intended that metrics and weightings remain unchanged from last year, with 80% based on financial metrics (net revenue, underlying EBITDA and operating free cash flow) and 20% non-financial.

LTIP grants will also be made at levels below the maximum levels permitted under the policy approved by shareholders at the 2023 AGM. LTIP grants will consist of performance shares (with a maximum face value of 150% of salary for the new CEO and 100% of salary for the CFO), and restricted stock units (with a maximum face value of 50% of salary for the new CEO and 40% of salary for the CFO). We will continue to set robust and challenging performance targets for both the bonus and the performance shares component of the LTIP, with vesting of restricted stock units dependent on the satisfaction of a financial underpin.

As in 2023/24, three performance conditions will apply to the performance shares: relative TSR (20%), underlying EBITDA (40%) and net revenue (40%), with each measured over three years. The underlying EBITDA and net revenue targets will not be disclosed at grant as they are currently considered to be commercially sensitive. They will be disclosed when this changes - no later than the report for the year in which the awards vest. The underpin applying to the grant of restricted stock units will continue to include an operating free cash flow measure.

## Conclusion

This year, Airtel Africa has continued to live out its purpose of delivering vital services and helping to transform the lives of its stakeholders. It has delivered strong underlying performance despite the turbulent economic situation in its key market and has laid strong foundations for future growth. This performance has been the result of the dedication and talent of our workforce under the leadership of our management team.

I would like to thank my fellow committee members for their continued diligence and dedication. We look forward to seeing your support for the new policy and remuneration report at this year's AGM and, more importantly, seeing the continued benefits of our work to all our stakeholders over the coming years.

I will be attending the 2024 AGM and look forward to engaging with shareholders at the meeting. In the meantime, if you'd like to discuss any aspects of this report please contact me through our company secretary, Simon O'Hara (see page 254 for contact details).

Chair, Remuneration Committee

8 May 2024

## Directors' Remuneration Report continued

## Remuneration Committee

-  Advises the Board on remuneration for Board members, executive directors, the company secretary, the Executive Committee and other senior employees
-  Makes sure that remuneration arrangements identify and mitigate reputational and other risks from excessive rewards and inappropriate behaviour linked to target-based incentive plans
-  Ensures targets are appropriate, geared to delivering our strategy and enhancing shareholder value
-  Makes sure rewards for achieving or exceeding agreed targets are not excessive
-  Promotes the increasing alignment of executive, employee and shareholder interests through appropriate share plan participation and executive shareholding guidelines
-  Reviews employee remuneration and policies and the alignment of incentives with culture, particularly when setting the executive directors' remuneration policy
-  Through the committee chair, engages with shareholders on remuneration-related matters

## Main activities in 2023/24

During the financial year, the committee:

-  Agreed annual salary increases and reviewed senior executive remuneration
-  Agreed the treatment of remuneration for the outgoing CEO and the remuneration for the new CEO
-  Implemented and made awards under our share plans
-  Determined the level of bonus payments for the previous financial year
-  Determined the level of LTIP vesting for the outgoing CEO and CFO
-  Drafted and agreed the directors' remuneration report
-  Received training in key areas of the UK Corporate Governance Code and The Investment Association's guidance
-  Held regular updates on latest investor thinking and emerging and future remuneration trends, including the expected impact of ESG trends on remuneration

## Shareholder consultation

A formal consultation with shareholders was not undertaken this year as no changes to policy or implementation are being proposed. Regular dialogue continues with our shareholders on matters of remuneration as part of our investor relations activities.

## Engaging with employees

The report on pages 115 to 116 explains our work on diversity and the various ways in which management engaged with employees during the year. While our committee doesn't directly consult employees on executive remuneration, a non-executive director attended our regular town halls at which a wide range of topics were discussed with our outgoing CEO, including employee remuneration.

## Effectiveness

The Board evaluation reviewed the committee's effectiveness and sought feedback from its members. The review concluded that the Committee continued to function well, with the management of meetings, quality of the Committee's relationships (including external consultants), communications with shareholders, the annual cycle of work and review and oversight of key areas of responsibility, considered to be effective. The results also showed the Committee to be effective in aligning executive remuneration with the Group's strategic operational and sustainability objectives. In response to the areas identified for focus in last year's evaluation, the Committee recognised the choice of ESG metrics to support greater gender diversity across the executive and senior management teams was showing results at the senior management team level. However, even greater focus at the executive team level was required.

We discussed the output of the 2024 evaluation and concluded that we had operated effectively throughout the year. Areas of challenge are identified in this report. We also confirmed our areas of focus for the year ahead.

We developed the policy taking into account the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the views of our major shareholders, and pay and conditions of other employees which were considered when the Committee discussed the new policy. The policy is intended to attract, motivate and retain high-calibre directors, to promote the long-term success of Airtel Africa, and to be in line with good practice and the interests of our shareholders. To avoid conflicts of interest, executive directors were not included in discussions on the new policy, and the policy was approved by the Remuneration Committee. The policy will be implemented by the Remuneration Committee.

The policy below is the same as that submitted at the 2023 AGM, but for minor changes to the scenario charts to make them relevant to the new CEO and the CFO, minor updates to the section on performance measures and approach to target setting in order to increase clarity, and updates to reflect the current non-executive Directors' letters of appointment.

## Key principles of our remuneration policy

Our committee took into account the UK Corporate Governance Code's six factors in Provision 40 in determining the remuneration policy. We believe the policy addresses these factors:

| Base salary          | To recruit and reward executive directors of a suitable calibre for the role and duties required | Normally reviewed annually by committee, taking account of company and individual performance, changes in responsibility and levels of increase for the broader employee population. Reference is also madetomarket levels in companies of similar size and complexity. Weconsider the impact of any base salary increase on the total remuneration package. Salaries (and other elements of the remuneration package) maybepaid in different currencies as appropriate to reflect the geographic location.                                                                                                                                                                                                          | There is no prescribed maximumsalary or annual increase. However, increases will generally be guided by increases for the broader employee population. Increases above this level may be made in specific situations to recognise development in the role, changes responsibility, material changes to the business or exceptional company performance. |
| Benefits and pension | To provide market competitive benefits                                                           | Benefits for executive directors will typically reflect their country of residence. Where an executive director receives an expatriate package, additional cash benefits may be provided. Expatriate benefits may include housing allowance, education allowance and homeleave tickets. Car allowances, life and medical insurance may also be provided. Statutory benefits as required under local law of the host country will also be paid. Pensions maybeprovided where this is in line with the workforce provision and statutory requirements in the executive's homelocation. Wemayalsoequalise for double taxation between the required work location and the executive's country of residence, if required. | Maximum values are determined by reference to market practice, avoiding paying more than is necessary. Where pension is offered, this will be in line with statutory requirements in the executive'shome location and in line with the wider workforce for that location.                                                                               |

- Clarity: the structure of remuneration is designed to support our company strategy, aligning the interests of our executive directors with those of our shareholders.
- Simplicity: We operate a simple remuneration framework, comprising fixed pay, short- and long-term incentives. The use of both performance and restricted shares may add a little complexity, but this is appropriate and critical to our talent agenda for the markets in which we operate.
- Proportionality: remuneration is set at competitive levels to ensure our ability to attract and retain premium talent. There is a direct link between the success of the strategy and the value received by executive directors.
- Alignment to culture: the remuneration approach supports our strategy objectives and reflects the diversity of our business. The structure of the package, and benefits in particular, reflects local practices and employment conditions in the countries in which executive directors are based and/or recruited from.
- Predictability: a significant proportion of executive directors' remuneration should be performance based. The policy sets out the possible future value of remuneration executive directors can receive.
- Risk: the package is appropriately balanced between the achievement of short-term and longer-term objectives and does not reward poor performance or encourage inappropriate risk-taking.

To also provide sustained alignment with shareholders through a component deferred in shares | Awards are based on annual performance against a scorecard of metrics aligned with our strategy, KPIs and other yearly goals. Financial measures have the highest weighting. Performance against strategic financial and non-financial objectives may also be used but will not normally account for more than 20%ofthetotal. The policy gives the committee the authority to select suitable performance metrics aligned to our strategy and shareholders' interests, and to assess the performance outcome. Onethird of any bonus is normally delivered in shares deferred for a further two years. Any dividend equivalents accruing on shares between the date whenthe awards were granted and whenthe awards vest will normally be delivered in shares.

PSPawards are madesubject to continued employment and the satisfaction of stretching performance conditions normally measured over three years set by the committee before each grant. The committee will have discretion to change the metrics and weighting from year to year. Major shareholders will normally be consulted before any significant changes. Awards of RSUs depend on continued employment and a financial underpin set by the committee before each grant. The LTIP vesting outcome can be reduced, if necessary, to reflect the underlying or general performance of Airtel Africa. Atwo-year post-vesting holding period also normally applies to LTIP awards that vest (net of tax) after the adoption of this policy.

## Discretion in operating the incentive plans

To make sure these plans are operated and administered efficiently, the committee has discretion in relation to a number of areas. Consistent with the marketplace, these include (but are not limited to):

## Choice of performance measures and approach to target setting

-  Selecting the participants
-  The timing of grant and/or payment
-  The size of grants and /or payments (within the limits set out in the policy table)
-  The extent and timing of vesting based on the assessment of performance
-  Determining a 'good leaver' and, where relevant, the extent of vesting for share-based plans
-  Treatment in exceptional circumstances such as change of control, when the committee would act in the best interests of our business and its shareholders
-  Making the adjustments required in certain circumstances (such as right issues, corporate restructuring, variation of capital and special dividends)
-  The form of settlement of awards in accordance with the discretions set out in the plan rules
-  The annual review of performance measures, weightings and targets for the discretionary incentive plans from year to year
-  The interpretation and operation of requirements related to the holding of shares in Airtel Africa

The committee has the right to amend or substitute any performance conditions if something occurs that would stop the condition from achieving its original purpose. Any amended condition would not be materially easier to satisfy in the circumstances.

Targets for each year's annual incentive and long-term incentive award are determined by the committee, and, if relevant, any one-off award for exceptional strategic initiatives, taking a range of factors into account. Financial goals include the annual budget, the relevant three-year strategic plan, analysts' consensus factors, wider economic facts and affordability for the business. Non-financial goals reflect the priorities of our business and responsibilities of the role.

The annual bonus is based on performance against a stretching combination of financial and non-financial performance measures aligned with our KPIs and operational goals for the year. As such, they typically include measures of revenue, profitability and cash flow, which reflect our focus on profitable growth, cash generation and satisfying our debt and other capital commitments. Executive directors and members of our senior management team are also assessed on personal objectives, as agreed by our committee at the start of each year. The committee reviews and adapts the objectives each year as appropriate to reflect the priorities for the business in the year ahead.

The committee sets a sliding scale of targets for each financial measure to encourage continuous improvement and to stretch performance. The policy gives the committee the authority to select suitable performance metrics aligned to our strategy and shareholder interest.

## Directors' Remuneration Report continued

## Part 2 continued

The performance conditions for the PSP and the underpin for the RSUs are based on measures which are key indicators of our growth, financial health and are aligned with our shareholders' interests. The committee sets a sliding scale of challenging performance targets for each measure for the PSP - for more on these targets, see page 158. The committee reviews the choice of performance measures and the appropriateness of the performance targets and TSR peer group, when relevant, before each PSP grant. While different performance measures and/or weightings may be applied for awards in different years, the committee will consult with major shareholders before making any significant changes.

The performance conditions for any one-off awards for strategic initiatives would be linked to the successful delivery of the strategic initiative and the creation of value for Airtel Africa shareholders. The performance targets would be tailored to the specific strategic objective, but would be set so that: (a) the maximum award would be only payable for achieving a stretching level of performance, and (b) the delivery of a 'target' level of performance would result in around 50% of the maximum award becoming payable.

## Legacy arrangements

Airtel Africa has the authority to honour any commitments entered into with current or former directors before this policy is approved or before their appointment to the Board. Details of any such payments will be set out in the remuneration report for the relevant year.

## Executive directors' existing service contracts

Our executive directors can enter into agreements with a fixed or indefinite term that may be terminated by either party on three months' written notice. At the committee's discretion, we may make a payment in lieu of notice - this is calculated relative to base salary and benefits only, paid on a phased basis and subject to mitigation.

Entitlement to both annual bonus and LTIP awards will typically lapse on cessation. In good leaver circumstances pro-rata bonuses may be paid and LTIP awards may vest in line with our policy and the plan rules. If a director commits an act of gross misconduct or similar, they may be dismissed without notice and without further payment or compensation, except for sums accrued up to the leaving date.

| Nameofdirector   | Date of service contract   | Unexpired term*   |
|------------------|----------------------------|-------------------|
| Segun Ogunsanya  | 1 October 2021             | 10 years          |
| Jaideep Paul     | 1 June 2021                | 10 years          |

*As at date of service contract.

## Approach to remuneration for the new executive directors

The remuneration package for a newly appointed executive director will be set in line with the remuneration policy in force at the time. Variable remuneration will be determined in the same way as for existing executive directors, and is subject to the maximum limits on variable pay referred to in the policy table on page 152.

The committee may also buy out any remuneration and contract features that an executive director may be giving up in order to become an executive director of Airtel Africa. Such buyouts would take into account the nature of awards forfeited and would reflect (as far as possible) performance conditions, the value foregone and the time over which they would have vested or been paid. Where shares are used, these awards may be made under the terms of the LTIP or under a separate arrangement as permitted under UK Listing Rules.

The committee may agree that certain relocation, legal, tax equalisation and other incidental expenses will be met as appropriate.

For an internal appointment, any legacy arrangements related to the previous role will be allowed to pay out as per their original terms unless they are bought out by the company, even if these are in conflict with the policy in place at the time.

## Service contracts for new executive directors and policy on loss of office

Contracts for new executive directors will normally include up to six months' notice by either party. This table summarises how the main elements of pay will normally be treated.

|                       | Goodleaver                                                                                                                   | Other leavers   | Dismissal for cause   |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|
| Base salary           | Payable for unexpired portion of notice period or settled by making a cash payment in lieu                                   |                 | Nil                   |
| Benefits and pension  | Continues to be provided for unexpired portion of notice period or settled in cash                                           |                 | Nil                   |
| Annual bonus          | Paid for period worked and subject to the normal performance conditions Paid following the relevant year end in cash         | Normally lapse  | Lapse                 |
| Deferred bonus awards | Typically vest on normal timetable without pro-rating for time                                                               | Normally lapse  | Lapse                 |
| Share-based awards    | Typically vest according to normal schedule subject to performance conditions (if applicable) and usually pro-rated for time | Normally lapse  | Lapse                 |

The committee would try to mitigate any payments in lieu of notice by, for example, making payments in instalments that can be reduced or ended if the former director wants to begin alternative employment during the payment period. We will pay as necessary any statutory entitlements or sums to settle or compromise claims in connection with a termination (including, at the discretion of the committee, reimbursement for legal advice and provision of outplacement services).

On a change of control of Airtel Africa, outstanding awards will normally vest early to the extent that the performance conditions have been satisfied. Awards would normally be reduced pro-rata to reflect the time between the grant date and the date of the corporate event.

If there is a demerger, special dividend or other event the committee thinks may affect the current or future value of shares, they may decide that awards will vest on the same basis as on a change of control. If there is an internal corporate reorganisation, awards will be replaced by equivalent new awards over shares in a new holding company, unless the committee decides that awards should vest on the same basis on a change of control.

## Remuneration scenarios at different performance levels

These charts illustrate the total potential remuneration for the CEO and CFO at three performance levels.

<!-- image -->

- 1  Assumptions:

Minimum

= fixed pay only (salary + benefits)

3.  Benefit values exclude the costs of business travel and accommodation.

On-target

- =   50% vesting of maximum bonus, 75% for the one-off strategic award and 55% for PSP awards and 100% for RSUs

Maximum

- =   100% vesting of maximum bonus, one-off strategic award and LTIP awards
- 2  Salary levels (on which other elements of the package are calculated) are based on those applying on 1 April 2024 and incentive levels are based on the implementation levels for 2024/25.
4.  To reflect the impact of a share price increase in Airtel Africa plc shares between award and vesting, the LTIP value in the maximum column has been increased by 50% in the share price growth column.
5.  The Outgoing CEO has not been included in the above charts as his departure has been announced and he will not be in role for a full year. A description of the treatment of his remuneration on departure can be found later in this report.

## Shareholder context

The committee considers the views of shareholders when reviewing the remuneration of executive directors and other senior executives. We consult directly with major shareholders about any material changes to the policy and work with shareholders to understand any concerns. For example, the committee consulted with major shareholders on changes to this policy during the development of this proposed policy.

## Directors' Remuneration Report continued

## Part 2 continued

## Broader employee context

The committee considers executive remuneration in the context of our wider employee population. Remuneration for executive directors is more weighted towards variable pay than for other employees so that more of their pay is conditional on the successful delivery of business strategy. Our aim is to create a clear link between the value created for shareholders and the remuneration of our executive directors.

## Notes

- 1  Segun Ogunsanya's benefits included ($'000) of: expatriate housing of $347, car benefit value of $73, and insurance costs of $16. Jaideep Paul's benefits included ($'000) of: expatriate housing of $89, car of $58, expatriate home leave tickets entitlement of $29 and insurance costs of $16.
- 2  Only Segun Ogunsanya receives a pension contribution of 10% of his salary - this is in in accordance with his legacy arrangements which reflect statutory requirements for employees in his home location of Nigeria.
- 3  For Segun Ogunsanya, the 2023/24 figure includes 580,474 PSU awards and 326,786 RSU awards which were granted on 28 June 2021 and will vest in 2024. For Jaideep Paul, the 2023/24 figure includes 308,212 PSU awards and 182,188 RSU awards which were granted on 28 June 2021 and will vest in 2024. The PSU awards were subject to a performance condition and the RSU awards were subject to a performance underpin, both of which had performance periods ending on 31 March 2024. The value of these awards has been estimated using the average price of Airtel Africa shares between 1 January 2024 and 31 March 2024 of GBP1.084 ($1.375). For 2023/24, the total value estimated attributable to share price appreciation is $231,000 for Segun Ogunsanya and $124,900 for Jaideep Paul.
- 4  The 2022/23 LTIP value for Jaideep Paul has been restated based on the share price of $1.392 on the vesting date of 30 October 2023 when 397,950 PSUs and 198,795 RSUs vested after application of the PSU performance condition and RSU underpin. The value in last year's report was estimated using an average share price.
- 5  Relates to the LTIPs vesting as a result of Segun Ogunsanya's treatment as a good leaver under the plan rules. The committee exercised its discretion to pro-rate awards for time and to test performance at 31 March 2024 based on an assessment of the performance condition in the context of the performance to-date and the outlook for future financial performance. As a result, 1,371,254 shares out of 2,164,266 shares under award are due to vest on 30 June 2024, i.e. 63.4%. The value of these awards has been estimated using the average price of Airtel Africa shares between 1 January 2024 and 31 March 2024 of GBP1.084 ($1.375).

## Annual bonus

Annual bonus targets were set in the first quarter of the financial year and, as set out in the annual statement, were based on the annual operating plan. Financial performance is measured in constant currency as this provides the best measure of underlying performance for a company operating in multiple countries.

At the time of setting targets, the Nigerian naira had already started to depreciate significantly. As a result, to ensure that the bonus would operate as an effective incentive throughout the year, the committee fixed the exchange rate for the naira at NGN752 to 1 USD on 30th June 2023, which reflected a devaluation of 63% from the exchange rate of NGN461 to 1 USD on 31 March 2023. Since then, the naira continued to depreciate to NGN1,303 to 1 USD on 31 March 2024. Other exchange rates were fixed at 31 March 2023.

Airtel engages with employees on a number of issues, including remuneration, in a variety of ways. For example, the designated non-executive director for employee engagement holds regular meetings with employees when he visits sites throughout the year, and Board members when they visit markets during any year hold engagement sessions with the workforce. Through these meetings and engagement, our board members inform employees on executive remuneration and receive feedback. This engagement approach is kept under review as we continually seek to improve the Board's dialogue with employees.

## Part 3 continued

Airtel Africa delivered strong underlying performance during the year, growing its customer base and modernising its 4G network whilst successfully adapting to a turbulent economic period in its main markets. In constant currency, revenue growth was 21.1%, underlying EBITDA growth was 21.3% and operational cash flow growth was 34%, all of which either exceeded or came close to the stretch targets. As a result, the outgoing CEO's bonus outcome was 95.9% of maximum and the CFO's bonus outcome was 98.1% of maximum. However, as set out in the annual statement, the committee reviewed the overall performance of the company and exercised discretion to reduce the formulaic bonus outcomes of 85% of maximum for the outgoing CEO and 87% of maximun for the CFO. One third of the bonus for the CEO and the CFO will be deferred into shares for two years. The tables below set out the determination of the bonus outcome before the application of discretion.

## Annual bonus awarded

The annual bonus outcome according to the targets set at the beginning of the year would have resulted in an annual bonus of $1,439.9k for the CEO and $876.1k for the CFO. Following a review of the performance of the company in light of the impact of the significant currency devaluations in our main market, a discretionary reduction of around 11% was applied to better align the incentive outcome with the shareholder experience, which resulted in the bonus amounts set out below.

Share price used

1  Average closing share price and FX rate for the three dealing days immediately prior to grant .

RSUs may not vest unless aggregate operating free cash flow is positive over the three financial years ending the year before the RSUs vest.

The performance conditions for the PSUs are based on three performance measures - net revenue growth (40%), underlying EBITDA margin (40%) and relative TSR (20%). Performance is measured over a three-year period, and this combination of measures helps to align the operation of the LTIP with shareholders' interests and our business strategy. Net revenue growth provides a key indicator of long-term growth achieved in the market. Underlying EBITDA margin is a key indicator of long-term growth in profitability from our operations. Relative TSR measures the total returns to our shareholders providing close alignment with shareholder interests. As set out in the annual statement, both net revenue growth and EBITDA margin are measured on a constant currency basis.

Airtel Africa operates only in Africa. We have three main competitors, none of whom disclose targets in their Annual Remuneration Reports. For competitive and commercial reasons, the Board does not believe it would be in the interests of our shareholders to disclose our net revenue and underlying EBITDA LTIP targets. The targets will be disclosed when they're no longer considered commercially sensitive. This will be no later than the year in which the awards vest. Our targets are based on the 2023/24 three-year plan and will require competitive market-leading growth in net revenue on a constant currency basis at target with more than 5% down and up to threshold and maximum. The underlying EBIT from an already high competitive base will be equally stretching, and both targets will be fully disclosed on vesting. On TSR against the MSCI Emerging Markets Communications Service Index, threshold will vest at the 50th percentile with the maximum at the 75th percentile.

## Deferred bonus awards

As disclosed in last year's remuneration report, awards were also granted in respect of the deferred bonus with respect to the 2022/23 financial year. Further information on these awards is set out in the table of share awards at the end of this report.

## Airtel Money One-off Award

As disclosed in last year's remuneration report, the CFO received a one-off award linked to a successful IPO of Airtel Money. An award was not made to the current CEO as discussions had already started regarding his potential retirement at the intended date of grant. An award has been made to the new CEO on 1 April 2024 in anticipation of his appointment. The awards were structured as follows:

- a)  Awards were granted on 1 October 2023 to the CFO and on 1 April 2024 to the new CEO
- b)  Base value of awards was 75% of base salary - $482k for CFO and $570k for the new CEO
- c)    Performance target is to grow the share price of Airtel Money from the amount paid by external shareholders in March 2021 to the date of vesting with
- i. 75% vesting for a threshold level of growth
- ii. 100% vesting for a stretch level of growth
- d)    Vesting will occur on an IPO (if achieved within three years of grant) or on a sale of Airtel Money were this to take place prior to the third anniversary of grant
- e)  The awards will be settled in shares in Airtel Money based on the share price at date of vesting
- f)  The awards are subject to clawback and malus
- g)    Shares delivered on vesting of the awards are subject to a one-year post-vesting holding period for the CFO and a two-year post-vesting holding period for the new CEO

## Part 3 continued

h)  The awards were made under a plan adopted by Airtel Money rather than under the Airtel Africa LTIP as original envisaged however the terms are exactly the same as they would have been had they been granted under the Airtel Africa LTIP.

The details of the performance targets, in particular the underlying share price of Airtel Money at date of grant and the growth targets set are considered to be commercially sensitive and will be disclosed following vesting (or if the awards fail to vest).

## Share awards vesting in relation to 2023/24

On 28 June 2021, the outgoing CEO and CFO were granted a RSU award of 326,786 and 182,188 shares, respectively, subject to an Operating Free Cash Flow performance underpin, and a PSP award over 735,268 and 390,402 shares, respectively, subject to performance measured to the end of 31 March 2024 against the following conditions:

All targets and achievements are in constant currency.

The underpin for the RSU awards required aggregate Operating Free Cash Flow to be positive over the three-year performance period ending on 31 March 24. Over the three financial years, aggregate Operating Free Cash Flow was $5,358.2, which resulted in the underpin being satisfied.

As a result the following awards will vest:

1   The estimated value on vesting is the average price of Airtel Africa's shares in the period between 1 January 2024 to 31 March 2024: $1.375 (£1.084). The estimated value attributable to share price difference is the change from the share price on the date of grant of $1.12 (£0.80).

## Share awards vesting in relation to Segun Ogunsanya's departure

As set out in the Annual Statement, Segun Ogunsanya will be treated as a good leaver under the share scheme rules. As a result, Segun Ogunsanya's outstanding deferred bonus awards, which total 386,021 shares, will vest in full on his departure. In addition, his outstanding LTIP awards, which comprise PSU and RSU awards, will be pro-rated and are subject to an assessment of the performance condition. Performance for the outstanding PSU and RSU awards was assessed in early FY2024/25 and the Committee assessed the performance of Airtel Africa over the elapsed performance period, for the Net Revenue and EBITDA margins, and the outlook for the business over the next 1 to 2 years. After making this assessment, the Committee made a further reduction of approximately 8% to reflect the uncertainty inherent in making a performance assessment before the end of the performance period. Furthermore, the 2023 LTIP awards were reduced pro-rata to reflect the time served in the period up to 30 June 2025, which is the date on which Segun Ogunsanya's relationship with Airtel is expected to end. The resulting RSU and PSU awards due to vest in FY24/25 are set out below:

| Award    | Shares under award   | Reduction for performance assessment   | Reduction for pro-rating   | Awards due to vest in 2024/25   | Percentage of award that will vest   |

## CEO pay ratio

As the majority of our employees are based in Africa, with only eight in the UK, we're not required to publish a CEO pay ratio. Given the numbers of employees in the UK versus those overseas and the fact that the people in the UK are mainly involved in operating our head office, the ratio produced by comparing CEO remuneration with that of our UK employees is likely to be misleading. As such, we've decided not to publish this information. However, the Committee takes into account pay relativities, employee wellbeing when setting executive remuneration, and we aim to be an employer of choice with a diverse and inclusive work environment that continues to foster a culture of high performance, wellbeing, skills enhancement, and coaching.

## Non-executive directors' remuneration

The table below summarises the fees payable to non-executive directors. During the year, our committee reviewed the Board fees. Following its review, the committee decided to increase fees in FY 24/25 as set out in the table below. In addition, it decided that the chair and members of the Sustainability Committee would become eligible for committee fees whereas previously only the chairs and members of the Audit and Remuneration Committees received these fees. In addition, the SID will also become eligible for additional committee fees when in the role of chair or member of a Committee.

## Executive Director service contracts

The outgoing CEO and the CFO have entered into agreements which may be terminated by either party on six months' written notice in the case of Segun, and on three months' written notice in the case of the CFO.

## Statement of directors' shareholdings and share interests (audited)

The beneficial and non-beneficial share interests of our directors and their connected persons in line with regulations, as at 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2024 (or on appointment or departure to the Board if different), are listed below.

## Executive directors (audited)

Executive directors must build up and maintain a shareholding in Airtel Africa equivalent to 250% of their base salary within five years of being appointed to the Board. Under the proposed policy, the CFO will be required to build and maintain a shareholding of 200% of their salary over the same time period. While the executive director is building to this shareholding level, deferred bonus awards (net of expected taxes) that will apply on vesting will count towards this requirement. LTIP shares that have vested and that are within the two-year post-vesting holding period will also count on a net of tax basis.

To deal with unexpected circumstances, the committee has the discretion to make exceptions and allowances if it sees fit.
