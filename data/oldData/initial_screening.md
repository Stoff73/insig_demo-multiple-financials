| FCF Yield       | 3.4%                      | Low FCF yield signals suboptimal capital return, partly due to ongoing capital investment and destocking cycle; capital discipline under watch.

Summary:

XP Power is a capital-light/moderate intensity power solutions manufacturer experiencing typical cyclical industry destocking and China market exit impacts depressing near-term revenue and profit. Operating cash flow remains healthy with strong conversion, reflecting disciplined working capital management despite lower free cash flow due to investment spend. Net debt reduction and leverage are within covenant limits. Earnings multiples denote earnings quality pressures from FX and amortization but no structural impairment. Valuation multiples near peer level but investor caution persists. The company is not distressed but in cyclical trough with improving signs. Crucially, it appears to face a fixable cyclical crisis rather than a terminal value trap.

The company’s financials and outlook support a watchful stance pending recovery confirmation while recognizing underlying operational resilience and growth investments underway.

This completes the primary ratios and contextual analysis as requested.

This indicates moderate insider alignment but no strong controlling insider stake.                                             |
| Recent Insider Transactions | No mention of recent insider transactions in provided files | Fail                        | No data on insider transactions such as open market buys, cluster buying, option exercises, or outright sells. Absence of insider buying or cluster buying post earnings or any option grants/exercises noted. This is a negative signal for insider confidence.              |
| Ownership Changes      | No explicit changes disclosed in files                          | Fail                        | No disclosures on insider ownership changes or new director buys prior to appointment are found in the documents. This lack of transparency or activity weakens confidence in insider engagement trends.                             |

Summary Paragraph:

The insider ownership in XP Power is approximately 5%, which places it in the "Watch" category based on the threshold criteria, indicating moderate but not significant insider alignment. The files reviewed, including official ownership breakdowns and the 2025 interim report, do not disclose any recent insider transactions such as open market buys, cluster transactions, option exercises, sales, or option grants. Nor is there evidence of ownership changes or new director share purchases before appointment. This absence of insider trading activity or ownership changes suggests limited insider confidence signals, leading to a "Fail" rating for insider transactions and ownership changes. Overall, while insider ownership is at a moderate level, the lack of insider transactional activity and ownership change disclosures recommends caution and monitoring. Further detailed insider transaction disclosures would be needed for a more positive evaluation.

Summary Analysis:

XP Power’s financial results for H1 2025 exhibit typical cyclical destocking and market exit effects that have compressed top-line and profitability metrics. Revenue and adjusted operating profits are down sharply, but improving order intake, book-to-bill above 1, and gross margin expansion signal that the trough phase may be ending. Operating cash flow remains strong and outpaces net income significantly, reflecting disciplined working capital management despite large capital investments. Free cash flow yield is weak, driven by ongoing investment and the destocking cycle, limiting near-term capital returns.

Earnings quality is impacted by FX losses, amortization of intangibles (£1.3m), and one-off charges, which have suppressed statutory earnings and distorted reported profits. Adjusted earnings show a marginal profit, highlighting underlying operational resiliency. The valuation multiples imply caution but do not mark the company as distressed.

Insider ownership is moderate (~5%), providing some alignment, but absence of insider buying or ownership changes during this period limits confidence in insider sentiment.

Conclusion:

The overall earnings of XP Power appear cyclical but not structurally impaired. The underlying operational cash flows remain strong and the efficiency measures underway provide a foundation for margin improvement. However, profitability is currently compressed by transient factors including destocking, FX losses, and one-offs, which reduces earnings sustainability and repeatability in the near term. Cash conversion is robust despite free cash flow being hampered by investments. Insider signals are moderate to weak.

Final verdict: Earnings are currently inflated by one-off pressures and cyclical downturn impacts, but underlying operational cash generation and order trends point to sustainability and repeatability being achievable post-recovery. Investors should monitor order momentum and capex discipline as key indicators of true earnings normalization going forward.

|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Liquidity                   | Operating cash flow £13.9m; Free Cash Flow £2.2m | Pass     | Strong operating cash flows with 290% conversion indicate excellent cash generation despite cyclically lower profits. Free cash flow down due to investment; liquidity sufficient to support operations and growth. |
| Leverage                    | Net Debt £57.9m; Net Debt / Adjusted EBITDA 1.8x | Pass     | Moderate leverage within covenant limits; net debt reduced by £35.6m due to share placing and cash generation. Leverage ratio is sustainable through market cycles.                                         |
| Refinancing / Default Risk  | No indications of refinancing difficulty; covenant compliance maintained | Pass     | No default risk or refinancing stress evident. Cash flow generation and balance sheet improvements reduce near-term refinancing risks.                                                                        |
| Transparent Liabilities     | No hidden liabilities; pensions and leases detailed in notes (briefly referenced) | Pass     | Footnotes disclose pensions and leases as per IFRS. One-off foreign exchange accounting charges disclosed transparently. No obscured or off balance-sheet liabilities noted.                                   |

Summary:

XP Power demonstrates solid liquidity metrics with operating cash flow substantially exceeding net profit, reflecting high-quality earnings conversion to cash. Although free cash flow is lower than prior year due to ongoing capital investments including new manufacturing facilities, the company maintains sufficient liquidity to fund operations and strategic investments.

Leverage is moderate with net debt to adjusted EBITDA at 1.8x, comfortably within typical covenant limits and showing improvement from prior periods due to successful equity raise and cash generation. There is no evidence of near-term refinancing or default risk; the company manages its liabilities prudently and meets all financial obligations.

Liabilities including pensions and leases are transparently reported under IFRS standards, with no indications of contingent or off-balance sheet liabilities that might obscure risk. The company has managed tariff impacts and foreign exchange risk with visible one-off accounting charges, increasing transparency.

Conclusion:

XP Power’s financial position indicates sufficient liquidity for current operations and investment plans, with sustainable leverage and low refinancing risk. Its liabilities are reported transparently and there are no apparent structural risk exposures. Despite cyclical revenue and profit pressures, the company’s strong cash flow profile and balance sheet resilience support ongoing operational stability and capacity for growth investments. Monitoring should continue on capex discipline and trade conditions, but currently the company passes all tests for financial confidence.
