## Valuation Profile

| Metric        | Value | Status    | Comments                                                    |
|---------------|-------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| EV/EBITDA     | 6.0x  | ⚠️ Monitor | Borderline valuation — not cheap, not egregious.            |
| P/E           | 21.1x | ❌ Fail    | Indicates market optimism unsupported by growth drivers.    |
| FCF Yield     | 3.4%  | ❌ Fail    | Subpar yield despite improved FCF; capital discipline risk. |
| EV/EBIT       | 7.6x  | ⚠️ Monitor | Slightly above the pass threshold; monitor margins.          |
