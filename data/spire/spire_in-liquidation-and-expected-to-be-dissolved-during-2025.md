# In liquidation and expected to be dissolved during 2025.

## 17. Subsidiary undertakings and non-controlling interest continued

In 2021, in order to simplify the structure of the group and reduce costs, the group undertook a process in which a number of companies within the group were identified for members' voluntary liquidation. The entities in members' voluntary liquidation at year end are shown above and they are expected to be formally dissolved at Companies House during 2025.

## Non-controlling interest

Financial information of subsidiaries that have a material non-controlling interest is provided below. The entities, as set out above, are Montefiore House Limited and Didsbury MSK Limited. In 2023, Spire Healthcare acquired an additional 24.9% interest in Montefiore House Limited, and now owns 75.1% of this entity. The accumulated interest relating to Montefiore has therefore been reclassified to retained earnings.

Within the entities, the most material assets and liabilities relate to right of use assets and lease liabilities in respect of property. Except for the lease rental payments, the majority of cash flows are generated through operations. In 2023, the group entered into an agreement with the non-controlling interest of Montefiore House Limited, in which both parties can exercise an option for Spire to purchase the remaining 25% interest in the subsidiary at a future date. The purchase price is calculated in line with pre-determined metrics which are based on the subsidiary's EBITDA performance and the group multiple.

## Guarantees with group undertakings for the year ended 31 December 2024

Spire Healthcare Group plc agreed to provide a guarantee, in the course of ordinary business to the below subsidiaries to take exemption from having their financial statements audited under section 479A to 479C of the Companies Act 2006. The guarantee to these subsidiaries is to guarantee outstanding liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, for the financial year ended 31 December 2024. In respect to this guarantee, it is judged to be remote that any cash outflow will arise.

Unbilled receivables reflects work in progress where a patient had treatment, or was receiving treatment, at the end of the period and the invoice had not yet been raised.

Other receivables of £6.2 million includes £4.3 million insurance reimbursement right (2023: £4.6 million); and £1.3 million (2023: £4.1 million) reimbursement right related to the Paterson fund.

The Paterson fund is being held by solicitors on account until payments are made, with any amount not paid out being returned to Spire Healthcare. During the year, £4.7 million was paid out of this fund and an additional £1.4 million was paid into the fund. The amounts paid to the Paterson fund do not reflect an investment in a financial asset, but merely a right to reimbursement should the fund not be utilised in full.

## 19. Trade and other receivables continued

Trade receivables comprise amounts due from private medical insurers, the NHS, self-pay patients, consultants and other third parties who use the group's facilities. Invoices to customers fall due within 60 days of the date of issue.

The group was successful in its bid to be included on the NHSE Framework for purchasing additional activity from the independent sector, which commenced in April 2021. Inclusion on the framework is at an agreed price for activity, based on the NHS tariff, but carries no guaranteed volumes. For contracts under the framework that include an estimated contract value, billing is in advance for the expected volume, with a quarterly true-up for actual volumes undertaken. For contracts under the framework without an estimated contract value (which can include local agreements), billing is in arrears based on actual volumes only.

The ageing of trade receivables is shown below and shows amounts that are past due at the reporting date (excluding payments on account where there is no right to offset these at the reporting date). A provision for expected credit losses has been recognised at the reporting date through consideration of the ageing profile of the group's trade receivables and the perceived credit quality of its customers reflecting net debt due. The carrying amount of trade receivables, net of expected credit losses, is considered to be an approximation to its fair value.

The loss allowance as at 31 December 2024 for trade receivables was determined as follows:

|                                           | Current   | 0-30 days   | 31-90 days   | 91-364 days   | 1-2 years   | Total   |

Trade receivables are written off when there is no longer a reasonable expectation of recovery. Indicators that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery include, among others, the failure of a debtor to engage in a repayment plan with the group, and failure to make contractual payments for a period of greater than two years past due.

The group assesses on a forward-looking basis expected credit losses associated with its debt instruments carried at amortised cost. The impairment methodology applied for trade receivables is the simplified approach, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the trade receivables.

Overview

Financial statements

Trade receivables after expected credit losses comprise the following wider customer/payor groups:

| (£m)                     |   2024 |   2023 |
|--------------------------|--------|--------|
| Private medical insurers |   31.1 |   29.5 |
| NHS                      |   30.7 |   25   |
| Patient debt             |    6   |    4.1 |
| Other                    |    9.1 |   10.7 |
|                          |   76.9 |   69.3 |

The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables during the year was as follows:

| (£m)                     | 2024   | 2023   |
|--------------------------|--------|--------|
| At 1 January             | 5.5    | 5.0    |
| Provided in the year     | 2.0    | 1.6    |
| Utilised during the year | (0.3)  | (0.3)  |
| Released during the year | (1.0)  | (0.9)  |
| At 31 December           | 6.2    | 5.5    |

The group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring Expected Credit Losses (ECLs) for trade receivables. Under this standard, lifetime ECL provisions are recognised for trade receivables using a matrix of rates dependent on age thresholds and customer types. The ECL rates are determined with reference to historical performance of each payor age group during the last two years.

To develop the ECL matrix, trade receivables were grouped according to shared characteristics (payor/payor type) and the days past due. As the majority of the group's debt is receivable from large, well-funded insurance companies, the National Health Service or from a large number of individuals, the group has concluded that historical debt performance of the portfolio during the last two reporting periods provides a reasonable approximation of the future expected loss rates for each payor age category.

## 20. Cash and cash equivalents

| (£m)                |   2024 |   2023 |
|---------------------|--------|--------|
| Cash at bank        |   33.8 |   20.7 |
| Short-term deposits |    7.4 |   28.9 |
|                     |   41.2 |   49.6 |

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, short-term deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments (including money market funds) with maturities not exceeding three months placed with investment grade counterparties which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.

## 21. Non-current assets held for sale

As at 31 December 2024 the group's management have committed to sell a parcel of land at Bostocks Lane as the group has accepted an offer on the property. The sale is considered highly probable and the assessment has not changed. It therefore remains as classified as held for sale.

## Capital reserves

This reserve represents the loans of £376.1 million due to the former ultimate parent undertaking and management that were forgiven by those counterparties as part of the reorganisation of the group prior to the IPO in 2014.

## Capital redemption reserve

During the year, the group announced a share buyback programme, the company redeemed 1,388,749 shares with a nominal value of £0.01 per share, resulting in a transfer of £13,887 from distributable profits to the Capital redemption reserve.

## EBT share reserves

Equiniti Trust (Jersey) Limited is acting in its capacity as trustee of the company's Employee Benefit Trust (EBT). The purpose of the EBT is to further the interests of the company by benefitting employees and former employees of the group and certain of their dependants. The EBT is treated as an extension of the group and the company.

During the year, the EBT purchased 1,312,000 shares and transferred 1,235,976 (2023: 1,339,634 shares acquired and 1,054,620 transferred) in order to settle share awards in relation to the directors' share bonus award and Long-Term Incentive Plan.

Where the EBT purchases the company's equity share capital the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs, is deducted from equity attributable to the company's equity holders until the shares are cancelled or reissued. As at 31 December 2024, 388,184 shares (2023: 312,160) were held by the EBT in relation to the directors' share bonus award and Long-Term Incentive Plan. The EBT share reserve represents the consideration paid when the EBT purchases the company's equity share capital, until the shares are reissued.

As with prior years, the company will continue to fund the Spire Healthcare Employee Benefit Trust (EBT), a discretionary trust held for the benefit of the group's employees, for the ongoing acquisition of shares to satisfy the exercise of share plan awards by employees.

## Hedging reserve

The balance of £2.1 million at 31 December 2024 (2023: £3.3 million) reflects the £4.3 million debit (2023: £4.4 million debit) recycled in the period, the fair value credit of £2.8 million (2023: £0.2 million credit) and the £0.3 million tax credit on the profit (2023: £0.9 million credit) to give a net movement of a decrease of £1.2 million during the year (2023: a decrease of £3.3 million) on a hedged transaction. See note 23 for further information.

## 23. Borrowings

The group has borrowings in two forms, bank borrowings and lease liabilities as disclosed on the consolidated balance sheet. Total borrowings at 31 December 2024 were £1,279.9 million (2023: £1,257.0 million). More detail in respect of these two forms of borrowings are set out below.

## Bank borrowings

The bank loans are secured on fixed and floating charges over both the present and future assets of material subsidiaries of the group. On 24 February 2022, the group successfully refinanced its debt facilities with a syndicate of existing and new lenders. The arrangement has a maturity of February 2027. The financial covenants relating to this new agreement are materially unchanged. The loan is non-amortising and carries interest at a margin of 2.05% over SONIA (2023: 2.05% over SONIA).

| (£m)                                       |   2024 |   2023 |
|--------------------------------------------|--------|--------|
| Amount due for settlement within 12 months |    3.6 |    3.4 |

| Total bank borrowings                      |  367.1 |  365.3 |

## Terms and debt repayment schedule

The maturity date is the date on which the relevant bank loans are due to be fully repaid.

The carrying amounts drawn (after issue costs and including interest accrued) under facilities in place at the balance sheet date were as follows:

| (£m)                      | Maturity      | Margin over SONIA   |   2024 |   2023 |

## 23. Borrowings continued

## Terms and debt repayment schedule continued

Net debt for the purposes of the covenant test in respect of the Senior Loan Facility was £323.8 million (2023: £315.4 million) and the net debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.0x (2023: 2.2x). The net debt for covenant purposes comprises the senior facility of £325.0 million, drawn revolving credit facility of £40.0 million less cash and cash equivalents of £41.2 million. EBITDA for covenant purposes comprises Adjusted EBITDA for Last Twelve Months (LTM) of pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA of £171.1 million (2023: £152.9 million) less the rental of a finance lease pre-IFRS 16 of £10.4 million (2023: £10.0 million).

The interest cover for covenant purposes was 7.5x (2023: 8.5x) and is calculated as the pre-IFRS 16 EBITDA described above over pre-IFRS 16 finance costs paid.

The senior finance facility includes a sustainability-linked element connected to environmental and quality factors. The group also has access to a further £60.0 million through a committed and undrawn revolving credit facility to February 2027.

## Effect of covenants

The group's non-current bank borrowings include borrowings amounting to £365.0 million that contain covenants, which, if not met, would result in the borrowings becoming repayable on demand. These borrowings are otherwise repayable more than 12 months after the end of the reporting period. The financial covenants are tested by reference to the most recent consolidated financial statements of the group, namely, 30 June and 31 December each year. The financial covenants are for the leverage ratio to be below 4.0x and interest cover to be in excess of 4.0x. As at 31 December 2024, the group complied with all covenants as the leverage measure stood at 2.0x and interest cover of 7.5x and therefore bank borrowings remain classified as non-current liabilities. The group is not aware of any circumstances in which there will be a breach in financial covenants.

## Lease liabilities

The group has finance in respect of hospital properties, vehicles, office and medical equipment. The leases are secured on fixed and floating charges over both the present and future assets of material subsidiaries in the group. Leases, with a present value liability of £912.8 million (2023: £891.7 million), expire in various years to 2046 and carry incremental borrowing rates in the range 3.2% - 14.6% (2023: 3.1% - 14.6%). Rents in respect of hospital property leases are reviewed annually with reference to RPI or CPI, subject to assorted floors and caps. The discount rates used are calculated on a lease by lease basis, and are based on estimates of incremental borrowing rates. A movement in the incremental borrowing rate of 1% would result in an 7.5% movement in lease liability.

In the year, the group recognised charges of £3.4 million (2023: £3.8 million) of lease expenses relating to low value leases and £17.0 million (2023: £14.8 million) of lease expense in respect of short-term leases for which the exemption under IFRS 16 has been taken. Lease commitments for short term leases are not dissimilar to the expense recognised. The total cash outflow for leases is £122.7 million (2023: £118.8 million). The group has not made any variable lease payments in the year. The group is a lessor to one lease to external parties and has recognised a finance lease receivable of £4.4 million (2023: Nil). The terms of the sublease are the same as those contained in the head-lease. There have been no (2023: no) sale and leaseback transactions in the year. Where new leases have the right to extend and management is not reasonably certain to exercise the extension option, those future cash flows are not reflected in the lease liability balance. If the option to extend was exercised the lease liability would increase by £239 million.

During the year the group sold its Tunbridge Wells Hospital business to Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust. As part of the sale agreement, the group has entered into a sub lease agreement with the trust to lease the Tunbridge Wells property. The finance lease receivable represents the cash flows receivable from the trust to settle the lease obligation in the head lease.

Overview

Strategic report

Governance report

Financial statements

Some leases receive RPI increases on an annual basis which affects both the cash flow and interest charged on those leases. Except for this increase, cash flows and charges are expected to remain in line with current year. The cash flows above do not reflect any termination, extension or break clause options as management is reasonably certain that the options will not be exercised. There are no significant restrictions or covenants which impact the cash flows in respect of these leases.

See note 14 for more detail on the depreciation of the right-of-use (ROU) assets and note 10 for more detail on the interest expense relating to leases.

The group entered into interest rate swaps on the 25 July 2022. The movement in respect of derivatives reflects £4.3 million (2023: £4.4 million) recycled in the period and a £2.8 million credit (2023: £0.2 million credit) in fair value. All movements are reflected within other comprehensive income.

## 24. Financial liabilities

## Financial instruments to purchase non-controlling interest

In 2023 the group entered into an agreement with the non-controlling interest of one of its subsidiaries, Montefiore House Limited, in which both parties can exercise an option for Spire Healthcare to purchase the remaining 25% interest in the subsidiary at a future date. On 21 February 2025, Brighton Orthopaedic and Sports Injury Clinic Limited (BOSIC) formally notified Spire Healthcare of the intention to exercise their option.

The purchase price is calculated in line with pre-determined metrics which are based on the subsidiary's EBITDA performance and the group multiple. The option can be exercised between two to five years. The expected future cash flow to settle the obligation is discounted at the group cost of debt of 8.1%. The financial liability is initially recognised through equity at the present value of future cash flows and subsequently recognised at amortised cost.

Deferred tax on property, plant and equipment has arisen on differences between the carrying value of the relevant assets and the tax base.

On the acquisition of Vita Health Group, a deferred tax asset has been recognised for losses as they are expected to be available for utilisation across the wider group from the fifth anniversary of the acquisition date. In addition, a deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of fixed assets. On acquisition, the group has recognised an intangible asset in respect of customer contracts. A deferred tax liability of £5 million was recognised in the prior year and is unwinding in line with amortisation of the intangible in future years.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realised or the liability settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, at the balance sheet date. The group has separately calculated the tax rates applicable in respect of adjusting items for the period. Deferred tax in the current period continues to be measured at 25%.

Deferred tax assets are recognised on the basis that the deferred tax liabilities represent forecast profits of the appropriate type (either capital or trading) and therefore represent a suitable taxable profit against the reversal of the deferred tax assets can be offset. Deferred tax assets and liabilities in relation to property are only offset to the extent that they relate to the same site.

The group has unrecognised deferred tax assets (which do not expire) as follows:

|                                        | 2024   | 2024         | 2023   | 2023         |

| Trading losses                         | 10.4   | 2.6          | 11.7   | 2.6          |
| Tax basis for future capital disposals | 11.6   | 2.9          | 11.6   | 2.9          |

These amounts are the expected tax value of the gross temporary difference at the enacted long-term tax rate of 25% (2023: 25%). A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of these amounts due to uncertainties as to the timing of future profits that the trading losses could be offset against and tax basis for capital disposals could be utilised.

## 26. Provisions continued

In response to the publication of the public inquiry report on Paterson on 4 February 2020, Spire Healthcare established a provision in respect of implementing the recommendations including a detailed patient review and support for patients. Since inception of the provision in 2021 £13.1 million has been utilised in settlement of patient claims. The provision to complete the reviews, settle any claims and costs in respect of other Paterson items has been increased by £4.6 million as reported in June 2024.

The provision was established by Spire Healthcare in respect of implementing the recommendations of the independent inquiry including a detailed patient review and support for patients of Paterson. The project is complex and the process for review and settlement of claims, where relevant, takes some time. The detailed patient review has now reached the milestone of having contacted all living patients and invited them, where appropriate, to consultations to discuss their care. As a consequence, the rate of new claims has dropped significantly, as most patients now have their outcomes of their review and have initiated their claim, where relevant. Claims activity in the second half of the year has therefore been in line with the assumptions taken by management and the provision established at the half year. As a result there has been no subsequent increase in the provision. In addition, £1.7 million of legal fees have been incurred for the ongoing inquests. While it is possible that, as further information becomes available, an adjustment to this provision will be required, at this time it reflects management's best estimate of the costs and settlement of claims.

As at 31 December 2024, the business restructuring and other provisions primarily includes dilapidation provisions for the primary care business. During the year the group released its provision related to acquisition tax matters other than income tax as the relevant tax years have closed for review.

Provisions as at 31 December 2024 are materially considered to be current and expected to be utilised at any time within the next twelve months, subject to external factors beyond the group's control.

## 27. Trade and other payables

| (£m)                            |   2024 |   2023 |
|---------------------------------|--------|--------|
| Trade payables                  |   84.9 |   63.9 |
| Accrued expenses                |   53.8 |   65.9 |

| Trade and other payables        |  214   |  197.1 |

Accrued expenses includes general operating expenses incurred but not invoiced as at the year end, as well as holiday pay accrued of £2.1 million (2023: £2.1 million), and bonuses accrued during the year and paid during the following year of £5.3 million (2023: £12.7 million). Deferred income of £10.5 million relates to contract revenue of VHG.

Other payables include an accrual for pensions and payments on account. Revenue is not recognised in respect of payments on account until the performance obligation has been met at year end the balance of payments on account was £2.4 million (2023: £10.3 million). In addition other credit balances re-classed from trade debtors were £38.1 million (2023: £32.0 million), which largely relate to NHS credits. Payments on account are expected to be utilised against patient procedures within the following 12 months. The balance of payments on account as at 31 December 2023 were utilised in the current year when the patient attended the procedure, and not cancelling or deferring treatment, such payments on account could result in repayment to the patient should they request so.

Since the end of the financial year, the directors have proposed a final dividend of approximately 2.3 pence per share. The dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and is therefore not included in the balance sheet as a liability at 31 December 2024.

## 29. Share-based payments

The group operates a number of share-based payment schemes for executive directors and other employees, all of which are equity settled.

The group has no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle any of the options in cash. The total cost in respect of LTIPs and SAYE recognised in the income statement was £4.2 million in the year ended 31 December 2024 (2023: £3.7 million). Employer's national insurance is being accrued, where applicable, at the rate of 14.3%, which management expects to be the prevailing rate at the time the options are exercised, based on the share price at the reporting date. The total national insurance charge for the year was £0.5 million (2023: £0.4 million).

The following table analyses the total cost between each of the relevant schemes, together with the number of options outstanding:

A summary of the main features of the scheme is shown below:

## Long Term Incentive Plan

The Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) is open to executive directors and designated senior managers, and awards are made at the discretion of the remuneration committee. Awards are subject to market and non-market performance criteria.

Awards granted under the LTIP vest subject to achievement of performance conditions measured over a period of at least three years, unless the committee determines otherwise. Awards may be in the form of conditional share awards or nil-cost options or any other form allowed by the plan rules.

Vesting of awards will be dependent on a range of financial, operational or share price measures, as set by the committee, which are aligned with the long-term strategic objectives of the group and shareholder value creation. No less than 30% of an award will be based on share price measures. The remainder will be based on

## Deferred Share Bonus Plan

The Deferred Share Bonus Plan is a discretionary executive share bonus plan under which the remuneration committee determines that a proportion of a participant's annual bonus will be deferred. The market value of the shares granted to any employee will be equal to one-third of the total annual bonus that would otherwise have been payable to the individual. The awards will be granted on the day after the announcement of the group's annual results. The awards will normally vest over a three-year period.

## 31. Commitments

## Consignment stock

At 31 December 2024, the group held consignment stock on sale or return of £25.5 million (2023: £24.5 million). The group is only required to pay for the equipment it chooses to use and therefore this stock is not recognised as an asset.

## 31. Commitments continued

## Capital commitments

Capital commitments comprise amounts payable under capital contracts which are duly authorised and in progress at the consolidated balance sheet date. They include the full cost of goods and services to be provided under the contracts through to completion. The group has rights within its contracts to terminate at short notice and, therefore, cancellation payments are minimal.

Capital commitments at the end of the year were as follows:

| (£m)                            |   2024 |   2023 |
|---------------------------------|--------|--------|
| Contracted but not provided for |   24.7 |   31.6 |

## 32. Financial guarantees

The group had the following guarantees at 31 December 2024:

- The bankers to Spire Healthcare Limited have issued a letter of credit in the maximum amount of £1.5 million (2023: £1.5 million) in relation to contractual pension obligations
- Under certain lease agreements entered into on 26 January 2010, the group has given undertakings relating to obligations in the lease documentation and the assets of the group are subject to a fixed and floating charge.

The group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:

- Credit risk
- Liquidity risk
- Market risk

This note presents information about the group's exposure to each of the above risks, the group's objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these financial statements.

The directors have overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the group's risk management framework. The group's risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.

## Credit risk and impairment

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the group's receivables from customers and investment securities.

## Trade and other receivables

The group's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The group's exposure to credit risk from trade receivables is considered to be low because of the nature of its customers and policies in place to prevent credit risk occurring in normal circumstances.

Most revenues arise from insured patients' business and the NHS. Insured revenues give rise to trade receivables which are mainly due from large insurance institutions, which have high credit worthiness. The remainder of revenues arise from individual self-pay patients and consultants.

The group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its ECL in respect of trade and other receivables. This allowance is composed of specific losses that relate to individual exposures and also an ECL component established using rates reflecting historical information for payor groups, and forward looking information.

During the period, trade receivables have increased in line with revenue, but aged debt has reduced. Individual self-pay patients continues to be the largest risk for the group given the current economic uncertainty. The group has considered the provision required and maintained a provision accordingly through the expected loss rate percentages, which is in line with the position at December 2023. The Expected Credit Loss (ECL) as at year end is £6.2 million (2023: £5.5 million).

Note 19 shows the ageing and customer profiles of trade receivables outstanding at the year end.

Unbilled receivables are considered for expected credit losses, but these are not considered material and therefore not recognised.

## Investments

The group limits its exposure to credit risk by only investing in short-term money market deposits with large financial institutions, which must be rated at least Investment Grade by key rating agencies.

## Market risk

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as interest rates, will affect the group's income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.

## Interest rate risk

The group is exposed to interest rate risk arising from fluctuations in market rates. This affects future cash flows from money market investments and the cost of floating rate borrowings.

From time-to-time, the group considers the cost benefit of entering into derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate volatility based on existing variable rates, current and predicted interest yield curves and the cost of associated medium-term derivative financial instruments.

Interest rates on variable rate loans are determined by SONIA fixings on a quarterly basis. Interest is settled on all loans in line with agreements and is settled at least annually.

|                             | Variable   | Total   | Undrawn facility 1   |

| 31 December 2024 (£m)       | 365.0      | 365.0   | 60.0                 |
| Effective interest rate (%) | 5.85%      | 5.85%   |                      |
| 31 December 2023 (£m)       | 365.0      | 365.0   | 60.0                 |
| Effective interest rate (%) | 5.63%      | 5.63%   |                      |

1.  If this facility was drawn the interest rate would be in line with the variable rate loans.

The group has an interest rate swap derivative asset of £2.9 million (2023: £4.4 million liability) in place (refer to note 23).

The fair value of this instrument is considered the same as its carrying value and level two of the fair value hierarchy is used to measure the fair value of the instrument. The variable rate consideration received by the group is Sterling three month SONIA.

## 33. Financial risk management and impairment of financial assets continued Sensitivity analysis

A change of 25 basis points (bp) in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased/(decreased) equity and reported results by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.

## Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The group's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the group's reputation.

Liquidity is managed across the group and consideration is taken of the segregation of accounts for regulatory purposes. Short-term operational working capital requirements are met by cash in hand.

Typically the group ensures that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses for a period of at least 90 days, including the servicing of financial obligations. In addition to cash on demand, the group has available the following line of credit:

- £60.0 million of revolving credit facility, which was undrawn as at 31 December 2024 (2023: £60.0 million undrawn)

The following are contractual maturities, at as the balance sheet date, of financial liabilities, including interest payments and excluding the impact of netting agreements:

## Capital management

The group's objective is to maintain an appropriate balance of debt and equity financing to enable the group to continue as a going concern, to continue the future development of the business and to optimise returns to shareholders and benefits to other stakeholders.

The board closely manages trading capital, defined as net assets plus net debt. The group's net assets at 31 December 2024 were £746.2 million (2023: £737.8 million) and net debt, calculated as bank borrowings of £367.1 million (2023: £365.3 million) less cash and cash equivalents of £41.2 million (2023: £49.6 million) amounted to £325.9 million (2023: £315.7 million).

The principal focus of capital management revolves around working capital management and compliance with externally imposed financial covenants see note 23 for more detail.

Major investment decisions are based on reviewing the expected future cash flows and all major capital expenditure requires approval by the board.

At the balance sheet date, the group's committed undrawn facilities, and cash and cash equivalents were as follows:

| (£m)                                        |   2024 |   2023 |
|---------------------------------------------|--------|--------|
| Committed undrawn revolving credit facility |   60   |   60   |
| Cash and cash equivalents                   |   41.2 |   49.6 |

## Fair value measurement

As of 31 December 2024, except for an interest rate swap and financial asset relating to a gross profit share, the group did not hold financial instruments that are included in level 1, 2 or 3 of the hierarchy.

Management assessed that cash and short-term deposits, trade and other receivables, unbilled receivables, trade payables and other current liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. The carrying value of debt is approximately equal to its fair value. During the year ended 31 December 2024, there were no transfers between the levels in the fair value hierarchy.

In determining fair value measurement, the impact of potential climate-related matters, including legislation, which may affect the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities in the financial statements has been considered.

A derivative is a financial instrument whose value is based on one or more underlying variables. The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate risk. Derivatives are not held for speculative reasons. Fair values are obtained from market observable pricing information including interest rate yield curves and have been calculated as follows; fair value of interest rate swaps is determined as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves.

The financial asset reflects a profit share arrangement with a partner. There are no market observable prices for the valuation. Management therefore assesses forward looking information and appropriate discount rates and risk factors to determine the fair value. Sensitivities are also taken into account when reviewing the fair value (note 16).

During the year, Spire Healthcare received a profit share in respect of the financial asset of £1.0 million (2023: £0.8 million). In addition an unrealised fair value movement of £4.8 million (2023: £3.0 million) was recognised in income upon review of the financial asset to increase the value of the financial asset on the balance sheet.

As at 31 December 2023, the group held the following financial instruments measured at fair value:

## Cash flow hedge

The group designate, as cash flow hedges, interest rate swaps entered into with three counterparties maturing in February 2026. These interest rate swaps convert floating interest rate liabilities into fixed interest rate liabilities. The swaps run concurrently with the hedged item, being the group's floating rate liabilities under the senior finance facility. For the years ended December 2024 and 2023, there were no significant amounts recognised in the profit or loss relating to the ineffective portion of hedges or portions excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The movement in the interest rate swap relates to fair value movement and is recognised through other comprehensive income.

## Fair value hierarchy

The group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique:

Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly; and

Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.

## 34. Related party transactions

Further information about the remuneration of individual directors is provided in the audited part of the directors' remuneration report on pages 111 to 122. There were no transactions with related parties external to the group in the year to 31 December 2024 (2023: nil).

## 35. Disposals and acquisitions

On 31 March 2024, the group sold the assets and operations of its Tunbridge Wells hospital to Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust. The group recognised a total profit on disposals in the period of £4.5 million. The profit is reported within adjusting items (note 11). As part of the sale agreement the group has entered into a sub lease agreement with the trust to lease the Tunbridge Wells property. Included in the profit is £2.0 million relating to the derecognition of the right of use asset (£2.4 million) and recognition of the finance lease receivable (£4.4 million). The finance lease receivable represents the cash flows receivable from the trust to settle the lease obligation in the head lease. In addition, the group entered into a management service agreement whereby Spire will operate the administration function of the hospital for a fixed monthly fee at an arm's length basis to allow for the proper transfer of contracts and operations. The management service agreement ended in September 2024. The profit on disposal is as follows:

| (£m)                               | 2024   |

## Notes to the parent company financial statements

For the year ended 31 December 2024

This section contains the notes to the company financial statements. The issued share capital and EBT share reserves are consistent with the Spire Healthcare Group plc group financial statements. Refer to note 22 of the group financial statements.

## C1. Basis of preparation

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted International Accounting Standards (IAS) in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and on an historical cost basis. The financial statements are presented in UK sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest million pounds (£m), except when otherwise indicated.

See note 1 for general information about the company.

The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as the directors believe there are no material uncertainties that lead to significant doubt that the company can continue as a going concern until June 2026 (see the going concern section in note 2 for more detail).

The company applies consistent accounting policies, as applied by the group. To the extent that an accounting policy is relevant to both group and company financial statements, refer to the group financial statements for disclosure of the accounting policy. Material policies that apply to the company only are included as appropriate.

The company has used the exemption granted under s408 of the Companies Act 2006 that allows for the non-disclosure of the income statement of the parent company.

The company did not have items to be reported as other comprehensive income; therefore, no statement of comprehensive income was prepared.

## C2. Significant accounting policies in this section

## Investment in subsidiary

The company's investment in subsidiary is carried at cost less provisions resulting from impairment. In testing for impairment, the carrying value of the investment is compared to its recoverable amount, being its value-in-use. In addition, market capitalisation is compared to the investments of the company when assessing impairment requirements.

## Share-based payments

The financial effect of awards by the company of options over its equity shares to employees of subsidiary undertakings is recognised by the company in its individual financial statements as an increase in its investment in subsidiaries with a credit to equity equivalent to the IFRS 2 cost in subsidiary undertakings. The subsidiary, in turn, will recognise the IFRS 2 cost in its income statement with a credit to equity to reflect the deemed capital contribution from the company.

## C3. Other areas of accounting estimates in this section

## Impairment testing of investment in subsidiary

The market capitalisation of the company is compared to the investment of the company to determine if there is a trigger for impairment review. Management acknowledged indicators of impairment at the year end, being, the net assets of the company are higher than that of the group's consolidated net assets and that the market capitalisation exceeds the investment value including intercompany receivables. The company's investment in its subsidiary has been tested for impairment by comparison against the underlying value of the subsidiary's assets, based on value-in-use calculated using the same assumptions as noted for the testing of goodwill impairment in note 15 of the group financial statements adjusted for the assumption that internal and external borrowings including lease liabilities have been settled. See note C9 for more detail.

Details of the company's subsidiaries at the balance sheet date are in note 17 to the group financial statements.

At the year end, the investment in subsidiary were reviewed for indicators of impairment.

Management acknowledged indicators of impairment at the year end, being, the net assets of the company are higher than that of the group's consolidated net assets and that the market capitalisation exceeds the investment value including intercompany receivables.

The recoverable amount of the investment is calculated by reference to its estimated value-in-use calculation adjusted for the assumption that internal and external borrowings including lease liabilities have been settled.

In order to estimate the value-in-use, management has used trading projections covering the period to December 2029 from the most recent board approved budget. The variables in the cash flows are interdependent and reflect management's expectations based on past experience and current market trends, it takes into account both current business and committed initiatives. In addition, management consider the potential financial impact from short-term climate change scenarios, and the cost of initiatives by the group to manage the longer-term climate impacts.

Management determined that no impairment was required as the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount by £623.3 million.

## Key assumptions

Management identified a number of key assumptions relevant to the value-in-use calculation, being EBITDA growth over the five-year period, capital maintenance spend, discount rate and the long-term growth rate. The assumptions are based on past experience and external sources of information.

The trading projections for the five-year period underlying the value in use reflect a growth in EBITDA. EBITDA is dependent on a number of elements of the operating model over the longer term, including pricing trends, volume growth and the mix and complexity of procedures and assumptions regarding cost inflation. The average annual EBITDA growth over the five years is 10.7%.

During the 2023 financial year, the group moved to a post IFRS 16 discount rate, and has used a pre-tax discount rate of 11.2% (2023: 11.5%).

## C9. Investment in subsidiary continued

## Key assumptions continued

A long-term growth rate of 2.0% has been applied to cash flows beyond 2029 based on long term view of inflation and market conditions. Capital maintenance spend is based on historic run rates and our expectation of the group's requirements.

Management has performed a sensitivity analysis using reasonably possible changes for each key assumption, keeping all other assumptions constant. The sensitivity analysis included an assessment of the break-even point for each of the key assumptions. The sensitivity testing identified no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions that would cause the carrying amount of the investment to exceed its recoverable amount.

## C10. Capital management and financial instruments

The capital structure of the company comprises issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the company statement of changes in equity totalling £1,302.5 million as at 31 December 2024 (2023: £1,237.5 million), and cash amounted to £0.1 million (2023: £0.1 million).

## Credit risk

As at 31 December 2024, the company had amounts owed by subsidiary undertakings of £475.0 million (2023: £406.7 million). The company's maximum exposure to credit risk from these amounts is £475.0 million (2023: £406.7 million).

## Liquidity risk

The company finances its activities through its investments in subsidiary undertakings.

The company anticipates that its funding sources will be sufficient to meet its anticipated future administrative expenses and dividend obligations as they become due over the next 12 months.

Dividends paid in the year:

| (£m)                                                                     |   2024 |   2023 |

Since the end of the financial year, the directors have proposed a final dividend of approximately 2.3 pence per share. The dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and is therefore not included in the balance sheet as a liability at 31 December 2024.

## Market risk

## Interest rate risk and sensitivity analysis

As at 31 December 2024 the company had short-term borrowings of £8.8 million (2023: Nil) owed to subsidiary undertakings, which are repayable on demand and bear interest at SONIA plus 2.05% (2023: SONIA plus 2.05%). Interest on these borrowings in the year amounted to Nil (2023: Nil) and the directors do not perceive that servicing this debt poses any significant risk to the company given its size in relation to the company's net assets.

IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures required a market risk sensitivity analysis illustrating the fair values of the company's financial instruments and the impact on the company's income statement and shareholders' equity of reasonably possible changes in selected market risks. Excluding cash and cash equivalents, the company has no financial assets or liabilities that expose it to market risk, other than the amounts owed by/to subsidiary undertakings of £475.0 million (2023: £406.7 million) and £8.8 million (2023: Nil) respectively. The directors do not believe that a change of 25 basis points in the SONIA interest rates will have a material impact on the company's income statement or shareholders' equity.

## C11. Financial guarantees

The below financial guarantees have been assessed in line with the requirements of IFRS 17 insurance contracts and are exempt as the guarantees have not been asserted explicitly as insurance contracts and as such the accounting for insurance contracts is not applicable.

## Lease arrangements with a consortium of investors

The company has given a guarantee to a consortium of investors, comprising Malaysia's Employees Provident Fund (EPF), affiliated funds of Och-Ziff Capital Management group and Moor Park Capital, in relation to the sale of 12 of the Spire Healthcare group's property-owning companies on 17 January 2013. With effect from 17 January 2013, the total third-party annual commitments of the group under these leases increased by £51.3 million per annum.

As a result of the sale, the group has long-term institutional lease arrangements (up to December 2042, subject to renewal or extension), with the landlord for each of the 12 properties. The leases include key terms such as annual rental covenants and minimum levels of capital expenditure invested by the group. The capital expenditure covenants measured on an average basis over each five-year period during the term of the leases, require the group to incur, in total, £5.0 million of maintenance capital expenditure and £3.0 million of additional capital expenditure on the portfolio of 12 hospitals each year, such being subject to indexation in line with RPI. If the minimum rent cover ratio is not met, the group is required to enter into an asset performance recovery plan in order to comply with the covenants, but no default would be deemed to have occurred. The company is a party to this guarantee. As at 31 December 2024 the group complied with the required covenants and the lease liability held on the consolidated balance sheet is £645.0 million (2023: £628.7 million).

Based on the liquidity and expected cash generation of Spire Healthcare Limited, the expected credit loss in respect of these financial guarantees, as at 31 December 2024, is not considered to be significant. As a result, no liability has been recorded (2023: Nil).

## Lease agreements entered into by Classic Hospitals Limited (novated to Spire Healthcare Limited)

Under lease agreements entered into on 26 January 2010 by Classic Hospitals Limited, a subsidiary undertaking of the company, the company has undertaken to guarantee the payment of rentals over the lease term to August 2040, and to ensure that the other covenants in the lease are observed. The lease has been moved to Spire Healthcare Limited, another subsidiary undertaking of the company, to allow Classic Hospitals Limited to enter Members' Voluntary Liquidation as part of the entity rationalisation carried out during the 2021 financial year. The initial rentals payable under the leases in 2010 were £6.3 million per annum, which will be subject to an increase in future years. As part of these arrangements, the assets of the company are subject to a fixed and floating charge in the event of a default. As at 31 December 2024, there was no breach in the required covenants and the lease liability held on the Consolidated balance sheet is £81.2 million (2023: £81.2million).

Based on the liquidity and expected cash generation of Spire Healthcare Limited, the expected credit loss in respect of these financial guarantees, as at 31 December 2024, is not considered to be significant. As a result, no liability has been recorded (2023: Nil).

## Shareholder security

From time-to-time, in common with other listed companies, shareholders may receive unsolicited phone calls or correspondence concerning investment matters. These are typically from overseas-based 'brokers' who target UK shareholders, using persuasive and high-pressure tactics to lure investors into scams in what often turn out to be worthless, non-existent or high-risk shares in US or UK investments. These operations are commonly known as 'boiler rooms'.

Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free company reports. Further information on how to avoid share fraud or to report a scam can be found on our website at www.spirehealthcare.com.
