## Helping to create a healthier and more productive Britain

Everything we do aims to help people return to good health, so they can get back to work and to doing what they love; changing lives for the better. We have evolved from being purely hospital-based to an integrated healthcare provider, able to care for people's physical and mental health needs, offering GP appointments and occupational health, as well as community and hospital care. We partner with the NHS to reduce waiting lists and welcome the government's renewed partnership agreement with the independent sector.

## Providing the highest quality care

Quality and patient safety is at the heart of everything we do, and we receive excellent feedback from our patients and regulators. In 2024, 95% of patients said they felt 'cared for' or 'looked after' in our hospitals. Our clinical governance, culture and systems for overseeing the practice of consultants have been transformed in recent years, and the implementation of the Patient Safety Incident Response Framework (PSIRF) at every hospital has further strengthened learning in 2024.

Our model for success continued

## Boosting the economy

We support the UK economy by investing in skills, technology and infrastructure, boosting productivity and contributing to net zero. We run a large nurse apprenticeship programme, and around 3% of our permanent workforce - over 380 people - are apprentices. By growing and developing talented people, we are helping to address the shortage of skilled professionals in our sector. We work closely with suppliers to develop partnerships that will deliver value for the wider community as well as our people, patients and their families.

## Supporting communities, global and local

We are investing in green energy and delivered another increase in recycling rates in 2024. Most hospitals are now fitted with solar panels to reduce our use of greenhouse gases for power and reduce energy consumption. We now have electric trucks and cars to reduce carbon emissions, and electric charging at our hospitals. The group raises money for local and national charities and hospitals form long-standing relationships in their communities.

Trading and self-pay demand in hospitals has been softer, but NHS is strong and our strategy is delivering; I am pleased to report an improved hospitals business margin of 18.0% from 17.6%. Vita Health Group (VHG) is performing ahead of guidance with revenue of £107.4 million and adjusted EBITDA of £11.0 million.

We are delivering sustained financial performance by helping to meet Britain's healthcare needs, and we do that by running great hospitals and primary care services, developing our colleagues and keeping our patients at the centre of care. We do this at scale, now caring for more than 1.3 million people a year.

Not only that, we have also delivered on my four key themes for 2024:

Listen up : embracing the gift of feedback so we are open, honest and safe

Inspire kindness : having an open and honest culture Being a change champion : driving business transformation and responding well

Making it count : delivering well as we continue to change and transform.

You'll read more about how we have done this throughout the report.

## A changing environment

We are delivering our strategy while responding to a changing market; we broadened our range of services to meet more healthcare needs in our hospitals, our clinics, in the community and at home, welcomed more NHS patients and invested significantly in the hospitals business. We have improved quality and safety through various initiatives.

We have a strategic partnership with the NHS, and continue to discuss the 2025 tariff with them and government. Increases to National Insurance and minimum wage are a challenge for many businesses and will add to our cost base, but we are addressing this by accelerating our efficiency programme. We are disciplined in managing both margin and growth through acuity (complexity) mix, price, optimal use of capacity and delivery of cost savings.

## Laying the ground for future delivery

We want to provide excellent primary and secondary healthcare services - continually improving the experiences of our patients, consultants and colleagues, through ongoing investment in quality and patient safety.

We recognise that we need to simplify our processes and, of course, improve our impact on the environment. This will help us to better respond to patient expectations of a faster, more digital experience; grow our margins and deliver a better experience for our patients, colleagues, partners and consultants; and benefit from advanced data capabilities, leading to better decision-making.

In 2024, the focus of our transformation programme in the hospitals business has been laying the foundations for digitalisation and operational change, securing efficiencies and preparing to initiate significant investment projects from 2025 onwards, working towards more visible transformation, modernisation and margin growth. To maximise performance in our hospitals, we are prioritising operational control, increasing capacity and maximising utilisation across our hospitals. We are leveraging our hub ways of working, such as new patient support centres in Cardiff and Seaham in Sunderland in 2024, and an expansion of the Essex site opened in 2023.

Chief executive officer's strategic review continued

On my regular visits around the country, I heard that colleagues want our systems and processes to improve and they understand the need for change, but change is always challenging. We have learnt from this first year of significant change and our leaders and colleagues have received significant support, including new strategic management support that considers all aspects of business change and its impact, including IT. I am extremely pleased at the delivery of phase one of our transformation programme and thank all leaders and colleagues involved.

As part of our integrated, group-wide approach to healthcare, Derrick Farrell, CEO of Vita Health Group (VHG), has been appointed to lead all our primary care services and now sits on our central executive committee.

## Investing for the future

In 2024 we invested £112.1 million in capex, including refurbishing five sites in Huddersfield, Cardiff, Sheffield, Edinburgh and Southampton. A significant investment has been £10.2 million on installing over 12,000 solar photovoltaic panels and building management systems across our hospital estate. This investment contributes to our sustainability goals and will reduce our demand for electricity and its cost. We continually seek ways to reduce the impact our business has on the environment and work towards our 2030 net zero target for Scope 1 and 2, and elements of Scope 3 GHG emissions. We are also focusing our efforts on waste and recycling. We have paused our purchase of renewable energy guarantees of origin (REGOs), credits which help to reduce our carbon footprint, in 2024 owing to a significant increase in cost. We would welcome further government investment in this area to enable us to achieve our net zero target.

Our cost savings programme is delivering efficiencies and customer service improvements. We secured over £20 million in cost savings in 2024 to increase shareholder returns, while moving forward at pace with the next phase that will deliver at least £80 million of cumulative benefit by 2026. We remain committed and well placed to deliver on our medium-term financial targets, but anticipate the delivery of margin targets moving back by one year, due to the additional cost pressures of national insurance, national minimum wage, energy pricing and shifting payor mix.

## Empowering our colleagues

To deliver our purpose, we depend upon a dedicated and engaged workforce. We aim to provide a stimulating, diverse, inclusive and healthy working environment in which colleagues can thrive and achieve their career goals and aspirations, and so we invest in our workforce through strong recruitment, retention and development programmes.

We are also focused on getting the fundamentals right on pay, benefits and reward for our colleagues. In 2024, we implemented a new job and reward framework in our hospitals providing clarity around reward and career progression opportunities. It will help us remain competitive, recruiting at the right salary levels and paying colleagues at the right level. I am grateful to all our hospital directors and colleagues who have worked tirelessly to get this right during a year of change.

Our 2024 annual colleague survey in November for all colleagues across the hospitals business, London Doctors Clinic (LDC) and Spire Occupational Health ran concurrently with VHG's colleague survey. It shows that 76% of colleagues are proud to work for Spire (2023: 81%) with a response rate of 83% (2023: 86%). It is pleasing to broadly sustain high levels of engagement and response through a year of fast transformation.

We continue to attract talented people to join our teams and have record levels of permanent employment in the hospitals business, high retention rates of 86.1% (2023: 84.4%), and the lowest number of vacancies for some time. We have also continued to manage our use of agency staffing.

During 2024, our equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) strategy was reviewed with a view to defining organisational-level targets to help us improve diversity and belonging within the business. I look forward to implementation during 2025. I am pleased that Spire is again listed in the FT Statista Diversity Leaders index as the leading UK healthcare company and as an FT UK Best Employer. The FTSE Woman Leaders Review and Women in Work have also recognised Spire for the involvement of senior women in our business for 2024/25.

## Clinical governance, quality and safety

Relentless focus on quality and safety is integrated into every aspect of our business. We collaborate and share vital information across hospitals to improve safety and encourage continuous improvement, ensuring the right conversations are happening and lessons are learned. During 2024, we have fully implemented the Patient Safety Incident Response Framework (PSIRF), significantly improving the quality of conversations between colleagues and consultants around learning and improving. Read more on this in Building on quality on page 25 and in Clinical governance and safety on page 103.

Delivering safe care in well run, high-quality hospitals and clinics is a fundamental underpin to our ability to deliver performance. Getting care right, as evidenced by patient, colleague and consultant feedback, meets our purpose and values and results in good commercial outcomes. For these reasons, quality is an integral part of every decision we make.

In 2024, 98% of our inspected hospitals and clinics are rated 'good' or 'outstanding' or the equivalent by regulators in England, Scotland and Wales, and 100% of VHG locations are rated 'good'. One hospital in Kent remains uninspected since 2016/17. We await the review, led by Dr Penny Dash, into the future of the Care Quality Commission (CQC) and safety regulation, and have contributed to the discussions.

All our business decisions, at central and local level, have clinical input and quality at their heart. The level of care we can provide in each hospital is clearly defined: by specialty, complexity of procedures and complexity of patients.

We maintain robust standards of clinical and corporate governance in line with best practice, while promoting an open and learning culture for all colleagues and using data to support hospitals on quality, and rigorous ward-to-board assurance. We are extending our robust governance approach to newly acquired parts of the business, seeking to share learning as we integrate services and develop new ones.

Overview

Chief executive officer's strategic review continued

At the heart of our growing primary care business is VHG which provides mental and physical health services in England. The other customer offerings are listed on page 5. I was pleased to see that VHG won the Health and Wellbeing Awards 'Best Company to Work For' award and the HealthInvestor 'Primary Care Provider of the Year' award, recognising their achievements.

We are continually improving our patient experience in the hospitals business. Our 2024 patient survey showed 97% of our hospital patients rated their experience as 'very good' or 'good', while 95% of patients said they felt 'cared for' or 'looked after' in our hospitals. Both of these are an improvement of one point on prior year. In VHG, 94% of NHS talking therapies patients were satisfied with their treatment.

We implemented a new patient experience framework in 2024, which provides a toolkit for each hospital to listen to patients, and the full implementation of PSIRF for all patients has resulted in a step change in our culture and approach to patient safety and response across our hospitals. We have also developed our driving clinical excellence in practice programme, launched in 2023, to support our registered nurses' and allied health professionals' continuing professional development.

I was thrilled that Spire was a finalist in the HSJ Patient Safety Awards in 2024 for 'Developing a Positive Safety Culture' and that we developed and led two sessions at the HSJ Patient Safety Congress, showing how we are leading the way on safety through integrating PSIRF, Quality Improvement and Freedom to Speak Up to deliver quality and safety within the right culture.

## Expanding our proposition

Our primary care services are also tackling the causes of ill health and low productivity, working in partnership with the NHS and corporates to care for more people, while offering synergies to our hospital business.

In 2024, VHG won new NHS contracts in Derbyshire, and Kent and Medway, the latter being the largest talking therapies service run by a single independent

provider and the former starting in 2025. Our contracts in Bromley, Oldham, and Basildon and Brentwood were renewed for an extended period.

2024, we launched a dedicated hip and knee network with Aviva as a preferred supplier across England, Scotland and Wales.

As part of a wider primary care strategy, we plan to push our services into new geographies, prioritising areas where we already have a hospital or clinic presence, linked to a patient support centre, increasing the opportunity for downstream revenue into hospitals and the ability to serve local communities better. It was pleasing to win new contracts for occupational health, including with a prominent UK retailer.

In 2024, we opened three new day case clinics to meet growing healthcare needs in our communities and to complement our 38 hospitals, as part of a previously-announced network of clinics. The first was in Abergele, North Wales, early in 2024, and clinics in Harrogate and Norwich opened in December creating links with new consultants and joint working with Spire Leeds, Spire Methley Park, Spire Norwich, and Spire Yale, including the new diagnostic centre we opened there in 2023. In late

## Working with the NHS

Waiting lists have remained sizeable, with 7.46 million treatment pathways at the end of 2024. The government seeks to reduce waiting times and modernise the service and is developing a 10-year plan to improve care, which is expected in 2025. In the early days of 2025, we agreed to support a new agreement between the NHS and the independent sector to work more closely together on relationships, systems and training and to care for more NHS patients.

In 2024, we cared for over 199,500 NHS hospital patients up on 2023. We proactively welcome more NHS patients to maximise capacity and worked on this in 2024. For example, we reached an agreement with the NHS to support the Sussex Health system, helping to reduce its list of long-waiting patients by providing treatment through a group of Spire hospitals in the south of England. Most of Spire's NHS activity comes from NHS GPs via the electronic referral system (eRS), which allows patients to book appointments with providers with the shortest waits.

## Leadership changes

In May 2024, I was pleased to appoint Harbant Samra as chief financial officer, taking over from Jitesh Sodha who stepped down. Harbant joined Spire Healthcare in 2018 as a group financial controller and became deputy CFO in 2022.

It was with great sorrow that we announced the death of Martin Angle, Deputy Chairman and independent Non-Executive Director in September. Martin had a distinguished career across banking, private equity and industry. He joined our board in 2019 and was chair of our audit and risk committee and a member of several other committees. I will personally miss Martin's knowledge, experience and passion for our business.

I look forward to welcoming Rebecca Harper to the new executive committee position of group corporate affairs director in April 2025.

In summary, our strategy is delivering and we have responded to a changing market with discipline. Thank you to all colleagues, consultants and leaders for their efforts and commitment during 2024. We remain confident in the combination of structural market growth, the growth potential of new primary care services, increased synergies between the two, and a continued strategic partnership with the NHS.

We are a diversified, integrated business with strong patient satisfaction and resilience for the future. In 2025, I look forward to further business transformation, the next phase of savings through operational efficiencies leading to growth, improved margin and benefits for patients and colleagues, and to contributing in even greater measure to the nation's health.

## How we generate revenue

## Private patients

We offer assessment, diagnostic tests and treatments at our hospitals and clinics. People have a choice of when and where they are cared for, in hospitals and clinics that combine excellent clinical outcomes with 'hotel-style' levels of service.

<!-- image -->

To read more about trends in the private health market, see page 19

## PMI

We have long-term contractual relationships with all the major private medical insurance (PMI) providers Aviva, AXA Health, Bupa and Vitality Health, which dominate the market. Patients' insurance covers future specified health needs, and when patients are cared for by us, agreed costs are covered by the insurer. We market a Spire-branded insurance product, inSpire, underwritten by AXA Health, which gives access to affordable private care at Spire Healthcare hospitals.

## Self-pay

Where patients pay directly for their care they can directly book treatments, without the need for a GP referral. Patients pay a fixed price directly for each treatment or procedure such as a consultation, scan, surgery, mental health session, physio session or GP appointment.

## NHS

We contract with the NHS to care for NHS patients, offering diagnostics, elective surgery and treatment and at our hospitals and clinics. Some work comes through block contracts, but most patients come to us directly through their NHS GP, allowing waiting patients to access care. Patients have the legal right to request NHS treatment in an independent setting and the government has agreed to promote this choice through a new agreement. Care is at the same tariff prices as local NHS trusts. The NHS agrees settlements with Spire annually for the cost of care and prices increased by 3.9% in 2024.

Through Vita Health Group (VHG), we provide talking therapies, musculoskeletal and physio services, and dermatology services for the NHS. Services are free at the point of delivery to patients, who can self-refer to services without seeing their NHS GP.

## Corporates

We provide over 800 corporates with occupational health services through long-term contracts and employee assistance programmes. Our services support corporates to keep employees healthy, protect and promote good health and provide services such as health surveillance, training and mental health support. VHG has contracts with 200 corporate clients and Spire Occupational Health has over 610. We also offer a pay-as-you-go model with smaller businesses.

## Our market

## Key trends

## Ongoing significant demand for safe, high-quality healthcare treatment is driving our market

The demand for healthcare in the UK remains strong - with accelerated demand for private healthcare, and the number of patients paying privately for healthcare continuing to increase.

We have a strategic partnership with the NHS and stand ready to take on more work, including increased complexity. We welcome patients exercising their right to choose where they receive treatment.

The number of people out of work in the UK due to ill health continues to increase, and with our expansion into primary care services including mental health and physiotherapy, we are confident we can help more people live healthier lives and get back to work, as well as supporting corporates to take care of their employees.

## Macro trends

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Population profile

The UK's growing and ageing population, and the prevalence of long-term conditions, are putting pressure on the UK's healthcare resources. The number of people in the UK who are economically inactive has grown to 2.8 million 1 , with those inactive due to long-term sickness on the rise since 2022. 2 In addition, 1.7 million working-aged people are suffering from a work-related illness in the UK. 3 One in four people will experience a mental health problem of some kind each year in England 4  and poor mental health is costing the economy an estimated 5% of GDP. 5

## Impact

- Total costs to Britain were around £21.6 billion in 2022/23, while in 2024, 33.7 million working days were lost due to work-related illness and injury. 6 There is an increased government spotlight on the need to get people back to work
- People continue to experience long waits to see their NHS GPs and are struggling to access community services for long-term conditions or other health issues
- In 2023, the NHS spent £217.5 million on medications to treat depression and anxiety. 7 Talking therapies are effective and confidential treatments, delivered by trained and accredited practitioners for conditions including depression and anxiety

## Our response

- We are committed to delivering a range of vital healthcare services to help improve the population's health, relieve pressure on the NHS and support those with long-term ill-health
- We continue to expand our range of primary care services including our physical and mental health business, VHG, and offer a range of services covering wellbeing, musculoskeletal therapy, mental health services and NHS talking therapies

## NHS

NHS waiting lists remain high, with 7.46 million 8 pathways although down from the all-time high of 7.8 million. In 2019, there were around 1,600 people waiting longer than a year for care; today, it is approximately 200,000, much reduced from 2023, but still much higher than before the pandemic. The 18-week waiting target has not been met for almost 10 years. Over 1.5 million patients were removed from NHS waiting lists via the private route in 2024 - at a rate of around 18,000 patients a week. 9  The new government seeks to reduce waiting lists and waiting times, move more care into the community, focus on prevention, and improve technology in the service.

## Impact

- The private sector is well placed to contribute to health provision in the UK. Government and the NHS recognise the need to work with the independent sector to care for NHS patients by using its capacity. The NHS spent £2.1 billion in private hospitals in 2023, up from £1.9 billion in 2022

## Our response

- Most of Spire's NHS activity comes from NHS GPs via the electronic referral system (eRS), which allows patients to book appointments with providers with the shortest waits. Tariff prices per procedure are the same as in NHS trusts
- We have a strategic partnership with the NHS and stand ready to take on more NHS work, particularly on longer-term contracts, allowing us to create capacity for diagnostics and treatment. We are contributing to the 2025/26 NHS Payment Scheme consultation
- We are engaging with NHS England on the new 10-year plan due to be published in spring 2025, and we contributed to a new concordat statement of partnership between NHSE and the independent sector

## Private market

The value of the UK's private healthcare market rose to a record £12.4 billion in 2023 10 , and while UK PMI penetration is low (c.15% of population), it is growing. Private hospital admissions for insured patients grew to record levels in 2023, with PMI established as the primary level of payment - now more popular than before COVID-19 - as more people understand the costs and benefits of PMI and more workplace schemes become available 11 .

## Impact

- The overall self-pay market for healthcare ceased to grow in 2024 but demand remains above pre-pandemic levels. More people are becoming insured, either through employment or direct purchase of policies

## Our response

- We care for private, corporate and NHS customers through PMI, self-pay, contracts with employers and NHS referrals. Spire works with all major insurers
- We are widening our integrated healthcare offering to span hospitals and clinics, including Spire GP, LDC, Spire Mental Health and VHG alongside the hospitals business. These services can meet more needs of local patients and are increasingly part of the value chain into hospitals
- We are disciplined on pricing and acuity (complexity) mix. We have implemented price rises and managed our mix of services and choice of products

## Healthcare workforce

The UK healthcare sector continues to face a severe skills shortage, with healthcare professionals leaving the industry each year. The combination of recent high inflation and labour shortages is also impacting upon the profession. A long-term NHS Workforce Plan was published in summer 2023, setting out the strategic direction for the workforce in England, addressing the shortfall into the 2030s by expanding training.

## Impact

- The current staff shortage in the UK's healthcare sector is creating strain on healthcare delivery and patient care
- Attracting and retaining the best people remains a challenge for all healthcare providers, both state and independent. Rates for agency staff and specialist clinical roles are rising owing to both shortages and inflation, presenting a further challenge

## Our response

- We seek to be a positive contributor to the healthcare workforce. We run a large nurse apprenticeship programme and offer a range of clinical and non-clinical apprenticeships, along with many training opportunities
- In 2024, we increased the proportion of permanent colleagues, improved colleague retention to 86.1% and reduced agency spend
- We are competitive in the reward we offer colleagues, so we can attract and retain the best people, and have addressed that in our salary awards and benefits programme

## Economic environment

Following sharp rises in inflation in the UK in 2023, the rate fell in 2024, but cost-of-living pressures are still affecting many people's disposable income. New government measures to increase national insurance rates for employers will add further pressure.

## Impact

- The economic climate and financial concerns have resulted in a complex inflationary environment that affects our supply chain, our operational costs and salary expectations. However, people will continue to need healthcare
- Spire has some resilience to these pressures. Our core customer is more insulated against rising costs, while our older, self-funding customers are less likely to have borrowing costs. We have shown that three-quarters of the population could obtain access to funds to pay for care if needed 12

## Our response

- We forecast that our significant investment in solar power during 2024 will result in a reduction of energy costs by 17.9% and 3% for building management systems
- The largest rise in our costs is colleague salaries, with increases to address the cost-of-living in 2022, 2023 and 2024, and we remain a competitive employer on reward
- Our continued investment in the transformation and modernisation of the hospitals business will yield significant efficiencies to offset rising costs
- Our continued integration of primary care services and creation of new care pathways will enhance margin

## Role for corporates

Corporates are increasingly expected by their workforce to play a role in preventing, maintaining and improving the health of their employees, through PMI, occupational health and wellbeing interventions. Over 25% of businesses offer PMI and one in five are planning to introduce it over the next 12 months 13 .

## Impact

- 16.4 million people in the UK are now covered by some form of private health scheme, up from 13.5 million pre-pandemic 14
- Corporates who prioritise employee health and wellbeing are better able to attract and retain top talent, and enhance overall business success

## Our response

- We are advising employees and corporates to support companies to have a healthy workforce, and broadening our primary care services into adjacent markets including occupational health, musculoskeletal services and mental health
- We provide mental health and musculoskeletal services and employee assistance programmes to corporates through VHG, helping companies to support their employees to remain healthy at work or aid those off work to recover and return to their duties, thereby improving productivity for corporates
- We provide services for corporates through Spire Occupational Health and VHG; prioritising occupational health yields benefits for corporates including reduced absenteeism, improved morale and complying with the law

## Our strategy

## Helping to meet Britain's healthcare needs

As a leading integrated healthcare provider, we bring together the best people who are dedicated to developing excellent clinical environments and delivering the highest quality care.

Informed by our purpose, structured through our business model, we have evolved our strategy with a clear direction; not only in hospitals, but also across a range of primary care services, so we can better respond to growing healthcare demand in the UK.

Our five strategic pillars are helping us to meet evolving health needs across England, Wales and Scotland. We are focused on quality and safety, investing in our workforce and expanding our proposition, as well as championing sustainability and driving hospital performance.

Over the next few pages, we describe in more detail how we have progressed on each pillar over 2024.

- Ongoing margin enhancement towards 21% by the end of 2027
- Further savings and efficiencies to deliver a cumulative £80 million by 2026
- Delivering patient support centres to improve efficiency and service

## Maximising growth in our hospitals

Performance in our hospitals business is driven by delivering a great experience for our patients, our consultants and our teams - ensuring safe care in well-run, high-quality hospitals underpins our ability to deliver results. Getting care right, as evidenced by patient, colleague and consultant feedback, results in good commercial outcomes and maximises patient safety.

Quality is therefore an integral part of every decision we make. All our business decisions, at both central and local levels, have clinical input and quality at their heart. For more see Strategy: Building on quality, on page 25.

We continue to improve our hospitals performance, ensuring all our hospitals work together to deliver our purpose of making a difference to people's lives through outstanding personalised care. We are doing this by transforming the delivery of our hospital services to our patients and our partners and investing in digitalisation.

To maximise performance in our hospitals, we are prioritising operational control, increasing capacity and maximising utilisation across our sites. Today, this remains a skilled, but manual, process that enables us to respond to issues of absence and cancellations in real time. Over the next two years, we will continue to automate these processes to further improve our resilience and performance. We have a clear plan for growth, including returning administration space to clinical use and growing our network of clinics and primary care facilities.

## Delivering efficiencies

We continue to roll out our efficiencies programme to deliver material savings, efficiencies and customer service improvements, and have an upgraded ambition to deliver a cumulative £80 million in savings by 2026, working towards an adjusted EBITDA margin for hospitals of at least 21% by the end of 2027.

Our strategy continued

We had a successful year in our business transformation of the hospitals business in 2024. Our focus in 2024 was securing the foundations and making sure that we have the internal and external security in place as we initiate significant investment projects, leading to more visible transformation and modernisation from 2025. We have improved the performance of core digital platforms such as our hospital management system, and delivered digital check-in for patients using a tablet, thereby saving time. We have also developed a sophisticated integrated PMI booking tool to help most PMI patients access outpatient consultant bookings more rapidly. In addition, we have completed much of the groundwork in 2024 to launch both a new customer relationship management system and a new consumer website in 2025. We are seeing encouraging momentum from new initiatives such as workforce planning and scheduling tools, and the transformation of our pathology business, better buying and procurement.

In 2024, we expanded our first patient support centre in Essex, which services five of our biggest sites around London, and opened new sites in Cardiff and Seaham in Sunderland. The centres bring significant benefits, meeting demand for patient bookings and reducing costs. Bringing teams together centrally has improved patient response, accuracy and service, with a reduction in average handling times and improved call capture rate. It has also enabled us to re-purpose space and increase clinical capacity by reallocating to clinical use and gaining economies of scale and revenue.

## Digitalisation

We are investing in digitalisation to work more efficiently; removing paper and automating repetitive manual processes. Our transformation programme will deliver savings, better experiences for our patients, teams and consultants, and give us advanced data capabilities to make better decisions and build long-term relationships - from improved appointment management, to updating electronic prescribing systems and observations that improve patient safety and clinical outcomes. By embracing data, exploring emerging AI technologies and fostering innovation across our organisation, our colleagues will be better placed to provide personalised patient care, with reliable access to the right tools.

Our move towards digital patient records will improve patient booking experiences with secure, reliable and instantly available medical records. We have also introduced automated invoice receipting for more than 50% of hospital invoices, enabling us to increase invoice volumes without increasing our team size. This process significantly reduces clinical time spent manually recording and uploading information, as well as improving patient safety and care.

Tactical deployment of Robotic Process Automation capex investment allows us to harness the power of automation and eliminate repetitive manual processes.

This programme of transformation requires careful planning and significant programme management support to ensure that we transition the hospitals business safely, without disruption to clinical care or financial outcomes.

## Increasing capacity

Our hospital directors, directors of clinical services and other hospital leaders maximise physical capacity and increase utilisation at our sites. We aim to make more of the space we have, such as moving work from theatres (if it can be done in an outpatient setting) to free up valuable space for more complex work, or returning administration space to clinical use. Physical capacity is the output of several factors: theatre space, beds, outpatient capacity and imaging, and the mix and acuity of patients. We have seen significant growth in utilisation over the past three years and measure sites with unused capacity.

## Strategy in action

## Excellence in clinical innovation reducing average length of stay

Playing our part in partnering with the NHS to improve safety and provide quality care for waiting patients is a key priority, as well as increasing capacity to support NHS elective recovery.

and no reports of readmissions due to unsafe discharge in those with a shorter length of stay.

In 2022, we started a project to reduce the length of stay for joint replacements, freeing up more beds to enable increased capacity. We also wanted to help reduce NHS waiting lists by seeing more patients more quickly.

Since launch, hospitals have created more capacity and treated 5,000 more orthopaedic patients, leading to an increase in revenue of £1.64 million. The average length of stay reduced by 0.65 days for hip replacement and 0.63 days for knees.

Connected to this, we have achieved a 60% reduction in avoidable venous thromboembolism (VTE) over 2023 and 2024, achieved through early mobilisation and improved hydration. All our benefiting patients have spent less time in hospital, while there have been stable levels of readmissions

Increasing ward bed capacity has enabled us to increase the number of NHS hip and knee replacement procedures. Compared with 2022, an additional 2,600 NHS procedures were carried out in 2023 and 800 in 2024. This is an increase of 19% in 2023 and 5% in 2024.

Faster treatment through increased capacity enables patients to return to normal life, contributing to overall wellbeing and removing patients from waiting lists. The shorter length of stay has also freed up key clinicians' time, allowing increased throughput without requiring extra clinical resources, such as physiotherapists or nurses.

The new pathway has now been introduced at some NHS hospitals, sharing the learning and further reducing NHS waits within an NHS setting.

Overview

Our strategy continued

In addition, we have directly increased capacity by opening three new clinics in Abergele in North Wales, Harrogate and Norwich. These day case clinics allow more patients to be cared for out of hospital and free up space in our hospitals.

## Investing in our estate

In line with our five-year refurbishment programme across our core estate, we have invested in improving many of our hospital sites in 2024, including highly-visible, patient-facing reception areas, new technology and sustainability developments to provide the best environment for our patients and colleagues and contribute to our net zero targets. Major projects have included:

- Over £4 million on major refurbishment at five sites in Huddersfield, Cardiff, Sheffield, Edinburgh and Southampton
- Over £6 million on five new MRIs and a further £8.5 million on X-ray, mammography and CT equipment
- More than £10.2 million on installing solar photovoltaic panels and building management systems (BMS) across our hospitals estate, with solar expected to lower energy consumption by 17.9% and BMS by 3%, and enhance the sustainability of facilities nationwide
- Over £2.8 million on fire safety

## Tracking our success

As a multi-site business, we have adopted a 'retail' approach to tracking performance and making trading decisions to drive consistency and give clear guidance to maximise performance. We use key performance indicators to track the performance of our hospitals. Through a combination of daily reports and weekly site-led forecasts of activity and cost, we review relevant levers to understand our hospitals performance, including digital traffic and conversion, bookings, workforce planning and costs, as well as key support functions such as IT systems.

We capture use and application of data across the business and use it to improve our insight and improve processes. We review the data we submit to external bodies such as PHIN, procedure registries and PROMs, and use our data extensively for internal assurance, as well as analysing consultant intervention ratios, feeding into our key performance indicators and key patient safety metrics.

Governance report

## Partnering with the NHS

We believe private healthcare has an important role to play in tackling waiting lists by working in partnership with the NHS. We continue to help the NHS recover: our volume of NHS work increased again during 2024 and we saw increased NHS volumes in the second half of 2024.

We supported the former government's Elective Recovery Taskforce in 2023 and gave our support to the new agreement with the NHS in early 2025, both of which aim to reduce waiting lists by using the independent sector. A continued role for the independent sector and more choice for patients, supported by the government and freshly promoted legal rights to choice, saw more than 199,500 NHS patients in our hospitals in 2024. We continue to engage and develop our relationships with the Integrated Care Boards that bring together providers and commissioners of health and care services across geographical areas.

We have completed the sale of Spire Tunbridge Wells to the NHS; we continued to run the hospital for six months and it is now fully in NHS hands.

## Services for children and young people

Children and young people are an important part of our patient mix. In 2024, we saw more than 45,000 children in our outpatient departments and cared for over 5,000 on our inpatient wards. We offer a broad range of paediatric services in a hub and spoke model with 12 hub sites offering full services and 15 spoke sites feeding in. Services range from initial consultation and diagnosis through to treatment and surgery, including general paediatric medicine, allergy, dermatology, orthopaedics, gastroenterology, and ear, nose and throat services with the latter the busiest service. We have introduced new services at some hospital sites, including cardiology and endocrinology.

## Outstanding clinical quality

Quality underpins everything we do, with the delivery of high-quality patient care and patient safety central to operations and embedded in our purpose and culture. As an integrated healthcare provider, maintaining quality is always our priority across our hospitals and primary care services.

We aim to deliver care to the highest possible standards at all sites, all the time. This means being uncompromising on patient safety, aspiring to the highest levels of incident reporting and the lowest level of moderate and severe incidents. We work hard to support our colleagues and consultants to ensure they have the skills and facilities they need to ensure patient safety. In 2024, 98% of our inspected hospitals and clinics are rated 'Good' or 'Outstanding' or the equivalent by regulators in England, Scotland and Wales. Both Spire hospitals in Edinburgh, Spire Clare Park in Farnham and Spire Cardiff were re-rated as 'Good' or equivalent. We are still awaiting reinspection of Spire Alexandra in Kent, which has not been inspected since 2016/17. All inspected VHG locations are rated 'Good' by CQC.

We engage with patients every day to better understand their experience in our care, their outcomes, and the broader patient experience before and after they came into our care.

## Delivering continuous improvement

We drive quality in the hospitals business around our own three core frameworks that encompass our approach to patient safety, patient experience, and clinical outcomes and effectiveness. We collaborate and share vital information and learning across hospitals to improve safety and encourage continuous improvement, ensuring the right conversations are happening and vital lessons are learned. We also believe it is important to create safe spaces for all our colleagues to reflect and gain insight on key matters, where they can hold professional conversations without fear of retribution; we reminded colleagues of their safety regularly in 2024.

Overview

Our strategy continued

The implementation of the new Patient Safety Incident Response Framework (PSIRF ) across our hospitals in 2024 has resulted in a step change in our culture and approach to responding and learning from patient safety events in the hospitals business. Our hospitals implemented this for all patients in all areas, beyond our obligation for English NHS patients. PSIRF promotes a proportionate approach to responding to patient safety incidents through a robust methodology and a system of improvement, with compassionate engagement and involvement with those affected. It recommends learning from incidents, with considered responses, and supportive oversight, focused on strengthening response systems and improvement. PSIRF's impact has been far-reaching; it has transformed our approach to responding to incidents and positively affected our culture. It:

- Empowers us to review and respond to patient safety incidents with robust engagement across multidisciplinary teams, including consultants and our resident doctors
- Addresses the whole patient pathway, not just an element of care, proactively bringing together different departments, so relationships are improved
- Ensures that learning is identified faster, and actions to make change are more meaningful and effective
- Enhances the creation of a psychologically safe environment for teams to share what has happened and ensure that we learn better and faster
- Influences our approach to quality as we use all the information we gather from PSIRF to influence improvement projects

For some patients, while rare, care does not go as planned. Our PSIRF plan, published on our website, highlights the incidents for which we have an increased focus. The PSIRF process supports us to engage early and transparently with colleagues and patients, and we undertake duty of candour when required. Learnings from incidents across all hospitals and sources are collated in our quarterly learning report which is discussed at hospital, executive and board quality meetings. We support hospitals with toolkits to share learning, and also share learning

Strategic report

Governance report outcomes across the group with 48-hour flashes, fortnightly consultant newsletters, and other means. We review our data in the context of other published data; in 2024, Spire was not an outlier for our transfers out, mortality or other key nationally published indicators. We monitor the transfer out of patients to another facility as a quality KPI, and review each transfer out to learn and spot any trends. These reviews have been significantly strengthened with the implementation of PSIRF and our transfer out rate remains very low. Spire's risk management system was upgraded in 2024 and now allows us to report NHS England patient safety events via the national system and to benchmark with all NHS providers.

Our patient experience and engagement framework enables our hospitals to focus on the key needs of our patients: it gives them the tools to probe their own patient data, and a toolkit for listening to patients. We rolled out this new framework across our hospitals in 2024 and internal feedback has been positive: hospital leadership teams are focused on improving patient experience and engagement by interrogating data and learning.

This framework aligns with our patient survey, which we use to understand key issues in care. We map findings from our patient survey against what we know to be important for our patients, as well as other comparable metrics such as friends and family (a metric used by the NHS). In 2024, 97% of our patients rated their experience as 'very good' or ' good', while 95% of patients said they felt 'cared for' or 'looked after' in our hospitals, both up one percentage point from 2023. In VHG, 94% of NHS talking therapies patients were satisfied with treatment, level with 2023.

As part of our patient experience and engagement framework, our hospitals hold regular patient forums to better understand specific issues raised by patients. They give us an opportunity to speak directly with our patients; they feed back on our patient literature and help to review and develop our services. Together with our surveys, this engagement helps us to identify areas for improvement and create solutions in partnership.

We are committed to learning and improving when incidents occur, including where patients are harmed as a consequence of care. Our hospital leaders attend a daily safety briefing with a standard agenda to share key developments and determine any improvements we can make. This is complemented by a weekly meeting for all central function colleagues. A fortnightly meeting for senior leaders is hospital focused and supported by a detailed weekly briefing for cascade. In February all hospitals implemented an additional safety huddle during out-of-hours working time.

Over 2024, we have also introduced a group national tissue viability lead to support our hospitals on wound management and care and advise on procuring equipment to manage patients needing wound care. In 2025, new digital enhancements will include eNEWS and AI - enabled digital records.

- Our Quality Improvement (QI) programme reflects our continuous improvement approach to safety and quality. We have introduced over 300 successful, locally led projects since 2022 and have delivered on our three national 2024 QI priorities:
- Reducing rates of venous thromboembolism (VTE) as a recognised complication of surgery: over 2023 and 2024, avoidable VTEs reduced by 60%, sustained using some of the PSIRF methodology
- Reducing average lengths of stay (AVLOS): in 2024, we reduced average length of stays by 0.65 days for hip replacement and 0.63 days for knees
- Improving patient experience after care: focus in 2024 on patients being clear about next steps after an appointment or on discharge

We have also developed a Knowledge and Learning framework to improve our approach as an organisation with sustained learning. It is designed to direct the creation, implementation and evaluation of shared learning across the hospitals business, ensuring it is aligned with strategy and driving improvements in standards and care. It will be embedded in 2025.

## Freedom to speak up

We believe culture is core to a safe patient environment. We support a culture of excellence and engagement, and we place a strong focus on having a culture of openness and transparency. Ensuring our colleagues feel psychologically safe is a prerequisite for improving quality and providing safe care. We support those who may feel that they can't speak out and remind everyone that they have a voice, will be listened to, and that there is an avenue to raise concerns or ask questions. We prioritise a Freedom to Speak Up (FTSU) culture, and we are proud of our network of 239 FTSU guardians and ambassadors (both consultant and colleague) across all clinical and non-clinical locations plus 6 in VHG. A key part of our assurance and oversight is regular hospital visits across all our sites by our board and leadership teams. The guardians are championed by our chief executive officer, who meets regularly with them. He also holds colleague forums without management present at site visits to encourage openness and trust. Two of the CEO's top four initiatives for 2024 were culture-based: 'listen up' and 'inspire kindness'. We are encouraged that, in 2024 surveys, 81% of colleagues say they are comfortable speaking up. We used colleague responses and feedback alongside listening sessions to shape our speak up strategy.

We submit our FTSU data to the National Guardian's Office (NGO) quarterly to support transparency; we regularly involve the NGO in safety meetings. The chief executive also spoke at the NGO's FTSU conference in 2024 on Spire's FTSU culture. We hold our annual FTSU month in October, aligned to the NGO national campaign, to raise the profile of speaking up and of the guardian role, as does VHG.

Colleagues can submit a Freedom to Speak Up concern via risk management software, which is managed by our trained guardians. Colleagues also have access to an independent, confidential whistleblowing helpline, enabling them to raise anonymous concerns. Training in this area is mandatory for all colleagues, and for consultants who practise solely in our hospitals. Colleagues use the NGO's three training modules: 'Speak Up' training for all colleagues, 'Listen Up' and 'Follow Up' are for managers. In 2024, VHG rolled out this training and FTSU efforts are now integrated across the group with monthly meetings, and all guardians attending one group annual conference.

We have been early to introduce Spire's version of Martha's Rule, called Ask to Escalate. This provides family members with the ability to request a second opinion if they are concerned. It also supports a culture of listening.

## Governance and oversight

We continue to strengthen our governance standards, assurance and board oversight, using data to support hospitals through comprehensive reporting processes. We have developed an assurance model which monitors policies and processes and identifies areas of excellence and improvement. The final level of assurance is the patient safety quality review (PSQR) process which ensures hospitals continue to provide high-quality care.

Our integrated quality assurance framework includes a clear meeting structure that enables 'ward-to-board' reporting. We have a suite of KPIs which are used at hospital, executive and board level.

A subset of KPIs are reported to the board monthly. An expanded report with a full suite of KPIs provides information, context and actions to our board (clinical governance and safety committee) and executive (safety quality and risk) quality subcommittees to support robust conversations around assurance.

The safety quality and risk committee, and clinical governance and safety committee, review all KPIs and forensically probe for themes, trends or opportunities for patient safety improvement. They scrutinise consultant performance; identify quality outliers by consultant, hospital, or procedure; ensure full compliance with our policies around multidisciplinary meetings, especially in cancer; and review specialist services such as cardiac and young people's services. They also review any learnings arising from mortality reviews and always receive a presentation from hospitals on patient safety improvement. Subcommittees of the board cover specific topics including incidents, QI, mortality, medical professional standards, VTE and data governance.

<!-- image -->

To ensure our central senior leadership teams are engaged in discussions around quality, we have introduced regular operational level safety, quality and risk (SQR) meetings that include reported data and heat maps to show performance across the business and improve assurance for senior leadership SQR meetings.

We have extended our robust governance approach to all parts of the business, including the services we provide outside of hospitals, seeking to share learning as we integrate newly acquired services and develop new ones. Our primary care services have the same reporting structures and senior leadership for VHG. London Doctors Clinic and Spire Occupational Health are now reporting into VHG.

We continue to ensure that we benchmark our quality standards against best practice, including using appropriate accreditation programmes. We have earned JAG accreditation for our endoscopy services at 14 sites; this accreditation is awarded by the Royal College of Physicians' Joint Advisory Group on Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. In addition, 15 of our 16 chemotherapy sites have Macmillan Quality Environment Mark (MQEM) accreditation, which champions cancer environments that create welcoming and friendly spaces for patients. In 2024, 35 hospitals achieved the National Joint Registry's Quality Data Provider certificate, with 25 receiving the 'gold' award (2023: 31 and 19).

## Investing in quality

We continue to invest in colleague QI training through our QI Academy. Over 2024, we carried out 34 days of QI training, including how to talk to colleagues, engaging with patients, and handling concerns and complaints to ensure we continue to deal with all cases with compassion and care. To date, more than 15,000 colleagues have accessed QI training, either virtually or in face-to-face sessions, and we now have more than 250 QI-trained practitioners. We also deliver bespoke QI training to our medical advisory committee chairs, business unit directors, directors of clinical services, finance managers and Freedom to Speak Up guardians. The use of PSIRF has increased colleague appetite for QI training by 100% with colleagues keen to learn how to be more effective and enable lasting change.

We carry out patient safety quality reviews to ensure we continue to provide high-quality care throughout our hospital network.

## Investing in facilities to drive choice and quality

Spire Portsmouth Hospital has completed a £6.4 million refurbishment to expand theatre capacity, refurbish patient areas and deliver a wider range of inpatient and day case treatment options for patients.

The new facilities have increased Spire Portsmouth Hospital's overall capacity and are intended to help care for more than 1,700 additional NHS and private patients a year. Our new day case facility increases the hospital's capacity to deliver more scans and investigative treatments, while the refurbished walk-in unit provides patients with fast access to orthopaedic, ophthalmology, gynaecology and urology treatments, without the need for an anaesthetic.

Our investment into new facilities ensures we can build our services to care for more patients, increase revenue and meet changing patient demands towards shorter stays in hospital. It can also alleviate pressure on local NHS waiting lists and reduce diagnosis waiting times in the local area.

The refurbishment has also created a brighter hospital with comfortable waiting areas and patient bedrooms, ten-day case suites, and updated patient bedrooms and ensuites. The new facilities ensure a better working environment for our colleagues and brought Spire Portsmouth up-to-date for its 40th year of operating in the local community.

National Safeguarding Week is an annual campaign supported by Spire that aims to raise awareness about the importance of safeguarding and protecting adults from abuse and neglect. It brings together organisations and communities to discuss key safeguarding issues, share best practice and promote safer cultures. In November, Spire Manchester hosted the Independent Healthcare Providers Network's Safeguarding Forum.

## Driving clinical excellence

Our clinical effectiveness and outcomes framework demonstrates that the care we deliver provides the desired outcome, in line with guidance and best practice. This framework covers five toolkits: national audits and registries, internal best practice, external best practice, multi-disciplinary teams, and clinical documentation. Each toolkit provides guidance and support on compliance, reporting, tools and support for our teams to ensure they are supported to deliver best practice, measure and analyse outcomes. We are rolling out this framework throughout our hospital sites and, by 2025, each hospital will have action plans to articulate outcomes and effectiveness.

Our five-year nursing and allied health professional (AHP) strategy (2023-2028) supports our nurses and AHPs to practice to high professional standards. It is structured around the core pillars of developing our workforce, delivering clinical excellence through practice and enhancing professional pride through celebration.

Our Driving Clinical Excellence in Practice programme supports our registered nurses and allied health professionals' continuing professional development and the requirements of their professional revalidation. In 2024, 350 people started the programme which is unique to Spire and is designed with the needs of patients at the centre. It reflects the needs of colleagues, their clinical competencies and incorporates lessons from incidents and themes from prior years.

Our hospital teams have really embraced PSIRF, engaged with it and embedded it. It's been a massive cultural shift - enabling our colleagues to make a change and make a difference.'

We recognise the dedication and care of clinical colleagues across Spire Healthcare hospitals who live our purpose every day. The new National Diseases Attacking the Immune System (DAISY) Awards recognise extraordinary nurses who are registered with the Nursing and Midwifery Council and rewards them for their nursing achievements. The Inclusive Recognition of Inspirational Staff (IRIS) Awards recognise all other clinical colleagues not registered with the NMC, for providing excellent care to our patients. Our colleagues can nominate each other, and we are also encouraging more patients to nominate colleagues.

We monitor excellence in our hospitals through an excellence in care delivery and safety framework to make sure colleagues are delivering the best quality care. We continue to review key safety and experience metrics thoroughly, listen to patient feedback and staff feedback, and monitor and assure around compliance.

We have introduced this professional framework, aligned with the national nursing and AHP strategy, to better understand how our colleagues are driving clinical excellence and quality within each of our hospital settings. We have standardised the objectives for all our directors of clinical services to make sure that every hospital is aligned to drive forward clinical quality and improvement, improve productivity and efficiency, and enhance quality and safety.

## Creating a positive working environment

We recognise and value the hard work and dedication of all our colleagues - and we seek to make a positive difference to their lives. That's why investing in our workforce is a key pillar of our strategy. Our four key themes for 2024, led by our CEO, were: 'Listen up' embracing the gift of feedback, so we are open, honest and safe; 'Inspire kindness', having an open and honest culture; being a 'Change champion', so our future works better for everyone; and 'Making it count', growing our business. We aim to develop, support and protect our colleagues within a welcoming culture that is characterised by openness, respect, collaborative working, a focus on clinical safety and a spirit of continuous improvement. We drive our colleagues to be curious and to challenge each other in a professional way to seek the best patient care, and ensure safety is paramount in the care that we're providing. We know when colleague, consultant, client and patient satisfaction join up, we see better performance.

We understand the importance of having highquality leadership in our hospitals and our board annually reviews the calibre and diversity of our leaders, and visibility of our succession pipeline. We have an agreed target for ethnic minority representation in senior management (see more in Sustainability on page 38).

We are focused on creating a positive working environment, where people feel that they can speak up, with Freedom to Speak Up guardians at all sites. We are investing in our employee experience as part of our commitment to supporting and protecting our colleagues and our business. For example, during 2024 we introduced new initiatives including our new managers programme to support colleagues in hospitals and central functions who have recently moved into a managerial role, and bespoke learning sessions to support teams across the business. In VHG, in-house mentoring sessions developed colleagues' skills, confidence and networks.

Annual Report and Accounts 2024

Our strategy continued

We want our colleagues to have a great work experience, and if they feel engaged, they can perform at their best. Read more on how we engage with colleagues in Sustainability on page 38.

## Equity, diversity and inclusion

We believe that diversity and inclusion are core to sustaining a successful business, and we aspire to create an environment where everyone is respected and cared for, and where difference is celebrated. We want to ensure that our colleagues feel confident to bring their whole selves to work, which in turn makes us stronger as a team and a business.

In 2024, we worked towards our new equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) strategy, examining and improving our data to better understand our colleagues, leading to improved insights into what changes should be made and to cultivate a feeling of belonging. We have identified areas that we want to focus on to either improve diversity or make positive change, and the strategy will progress in 2025.

Our network groups provide safe spaces for our diverse colleagues to discuss issues of relevance, raise awareness and influence, and include our Let's Talk LGBTQ+ network, menopause network and race equality network in the hospitals business and further networks on women, LGBTQIA+ and race equality in VHG.

We were pleased to again be listed in the FT Statista Diversity Leaders index as the leading UK healthcare company, based on a survey of 100,000 employees across Europe. For the first time we were ranked 254 by the FT UK's Best Employers 2025, of 500 companies ranked and 20,000 surveyed. We were also ranked as 4th in the FTSE 250 Women Leaders Review and in the top 100 businesses by Women in Work for senior female leaders, who also praised us for having transparent maternity policies available for job applicants. Read more on diversity in Sustainability on page 38.

## Valuing and rewarding colleagues

We are focused on getting the fundamentals right on pay, benefits and reward for our colleagues. We have invested in pay and reward this year with the implementation of our new reward framework across our hospitals business, which maps all our core

Overview

Strategic report

Governance report roles and associated salaries. The framework was shaped through listening sessions with colleagues and senior leaders. Our robust structure ensures fairness and equity, with clarity on where colleagues fit in our structure and how they are rewarded. It will also help us ensure that we remain competitive recruiting at the right salary levels and paying colleagues at the right level.

With the ongoing cost-of-living pressures, our colleagues want clarity and certainty about their pay. That's why for all eligible colleagues we prioritised a 2.75% salary increase from September 2024, announced in May to give colleagues predictability. It should be noted that the introduction of increased national insurance contributions for employees in 2025 will add to our cost base. In 2024 we got ahead of this by increasing and accelerating our efficiencies programmes.

During a year of change, our HR colleagues gave significant support to all projects, recruiting and inducting a large number of colleagues, supporting reward framework conversations, and redeploying people into new roles during business transformation, and this will continue in 2025.

Most colleagues have access to PMI cover, and access to a comprehensive health assessment every other year. In 2024, we introduced a menopause assessment as an additional choice. We also offer a comprehensive employee assistance programme, providing confidential advice support online and via a free helpline, available 24/7 to clinical and non-clinical employees.

## Mental health and wellbeing

Colleagues working in our hospitals hold emotional and challenging roles. Our network of trained volunteer mental health first aiders support colleagues at our hospital sites. In 2024, we ran new and refreshed training to ensure our first aiders have the support they need and the opportunity to acquire additional skillsets that prioritise self-care before helping their colleagues. We delivered five personal resilience courses to support colleagues to recover from adversity, stress and difficult situations. In autumn 2024, we ran a 'Kindness works here' campaign, covering colleagues' physical, emotional, mental, social and spiritual wellbeing.

Strategy in action

## Investing in apprentices

Professional development is an important part of our offer to attract and retain the best people at Spire Healthcare.

In February, we appointed our first oncology support pharmacy technician at Spire Montefiore. This role runs the oncology pharmacy service with remote support, speeding up care for our patients.

At Spire, we encourage employees to share our value of investing in the future, by investing in their own learning and development to build their skills for the future. By growing and developing talented people, we are helping to address the shortage of skilled professionals in the health sector. We offer apprenticeships across the country in a range of skills including nursing, biomedical science, physiotherapy, laboratory work and engineering.

It was borne from our apprenticeship programme, where we supported an apprentice through a two-year apprenticeship after four years in community pharmacy elsewhere, leading to a Level 3 Pharmacy Technician apprenticeship in June 2023, and further training with the lead oncology pharmacist in 2024.

Some of our apprentices are school leavers, others join us mid-career, and a significant group already work for Spire but seek to improve and develop with us. Read more in Sustainability on page 45.

Our strategy continued

## Bringing recruitment in-house

Our workforce is a critical enabler to deliver our strategy, and resourcing well remains important to building capacity across our services. We brought resourcing in-house in 2023, and over 2024 fully realised the benefits of developing and managing our own recruitment capability. While vacancies are a continuing challenge across the healthcare sector, notably for specialist clinical roles, the past year has seen high rates of fulfilment with reduced turnover.

We continue to attract talented people to join our teams, and actively promote people to new roles from within. We have record levels of permanent employment in the hospitals business, high retention rates of 86.1% (2023: 84.4%), and the lowest number of vacancies for some time, with a 20% increase in the number of permanent offers made to new colleagues, compared to 2023. This drives continuity of care to our patients and reduces our reliance on agency, leading to improvements in safety, quality and patient experience.

Agency costs remain a key area to manage for all healthcare providers, and rates for specialist skills have increased, but we are controlling them well. We have a single agency booking system, with a master agreement in place. This helps us to manage our agencies and see all costs up front, while retaining necessary flexibility for our workforce.

## Working with consultants

Our practising consultant partners operate as self-employed practitioners in our hospitals across all medical and surgical disciplines. Each hospital's medical advisory committee (MAC) meets quarterly to ensure proper, safe, efficient and ethical medical use of the hospital. In addition, the MAC chair meets regularly with the hospital director.

It is important that we engage with consultants and make it easy for them to do business with us, not only so they understand our quality standards and how we wish care to be delivered, but also so we can support them as they develop their business. Over 2024, we spent time listening to them and understanding the consultant journey - from first referral to patient discharge. In summer 2024, we introduced a new consultant induction handbook and in-person consultant private practice development sessions to support those new to private practice and ensure that they are clear on their responsibilities when practising with us; both developments have received positive feedback and ensure a national approach.

Our annual consultant survey in 2024 showed that 84% of consultants now state that the care provided in hospitals is 'very good' or 'excellent' (2023: 83%). The percentage of consultants rating the quality of service provided to them by our hospitals as 'very good' or 'excellent' is 70% (2023: 69%). We use findings from the consultant survey for each hospital leadership team to develop action plans.

<!-- image -->

## Absence and turnover

Managing absence and turnover supports our colleagues' wellbeing, is essential to maintaining a stable and productive workforce, and ensures continuity of care for patients. We use data to flex our workforce and manage capacity and resilience.

Absence rates in the hospitals business were level with 2023, though short-term absence continued to decline. The overall rate of absence was 4.7%. Our monthly turnover rate continued to reduce, to 13.3% (2023: 15.1%), with 6.7% fewer leavers in 2024. The highest recorded reasons for leaving are changes in personal circumstances, career progression and retirement; our focus continues to be on career development and flexible working solutions. The market for talented people remains competitive, with demand for nurses particularly high.

Absence rose slightly at Vita Health Group during 2024 with an overall rate of absence of 3.7% (3.6% in 2023). Turnover fell from 23.5% in 2023 to 18.3% in 2024. Absence at The Doctors Clinic Group during 2024 was 1.65% overall (1.2% in 2023), and turnover was 45% (46% in 2023).

## Championing sustainability

Sustainability is a core component of Spire Healthcare's strategy and operations. By managing sustainability successfully, we aim to create lasting social economic value. Our ability to succeed today and plan for tomorrow depends on us being able to positively contribute towards enhancing the world for current and future generations.

We have an important societal role to play as our delivery of people's care contributes to the health of the nation, and benefits society. As we execute our strategy, we seek to take a long-term view, whether through the investments we make in our colleagues, hospitals, clinics and services, or our interactions with the communities that we serve.

We aim to develop a business that is fit for purpose now and capable of providing lasting impact in the future. We believe that acting conscientiously as a business and investing responsibly to achieve positive social and environmental outcomes, are critical to the long-term success of the group.

Our sustainability strategy charts our progressive journey from risk management to providing social value and driving opportunities for sustainable growth. We actively collaborate with our stakeholders, including patients, colleagues, consultants, local communities and partners, to enrich lives and be a net contributor to society, not just through the services we provide, but in everything we do. This includes challenging our colleagues and the people we work with to factor sustainability into everything they do.

Our ambition, through our sustainability strategy*, is to become recognised as a leader in sustainability in our industry and we are implementing this through our three-pronged sustainability strategy, outlined on page 33.

* The sustainability strategy was written for the hospitals business. We anticipate working to bring the rest of the group under the same plan in 2025.

Our strategy continued

## Respect the environment

We are committed to minimising the environmental impact of our operations and maintaining the group's resilience to environmental risks and impacts.

## Engage our people and communities

We are a people business. By hiring talented people and providing an environment in which to grow and develop their careers, our patients and the communities with whom we interact, and society at large, will benefit.

## Operate responsibly

We aim to operate to the highest standards in everything we do, ensuring honesty, integrity, proper governance and compliance at all times. We promote an ethical culture across the group.

<!-- image -->

## Principles

-  Growing a profitable, successful, robust and, ultimately, sustainable company, and being a net contributor to society are not mutually exclusive goals
-  Need for a clear sense of purpose, consistent values and a persistent desire to engage with and deliver for a broad set of stakeholders

## How we manage sustainability

Responsibility for approving Spire Healthcare's sustainability strategy and overseeing its delivery rests with the board of directors. Regular progress updates are provided at board meetings. Our Chief Financial Officer, Harbant Samra, oversees delivery of the sustainability strategy at a business level, while our executive committee tracks progress towards the group's sustainability targets on an ongoing basis throughout the year.

Our cross-functional internal sustainability committee brings together six members from across the business. The sustainability committee reports to the executive committee and acts with delegated authority. It meets quarterly to share progress on delivering actions and meeting targets and explore initiatives that will accelerate our progress and identify associated risks and opportunities.

The main roles and responsibilities of the sustainability committee are to:

1.  Oversee, review and advise the executive committee on the company's strategies, objectives and commitments related to sustainability and environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors
2.  Oversee, review and recommend changes to Spire Healthcare's sustainability-related goals, objectives, commitments and key performance indicators and monitor our progress against them

During 2024, the committee was reviewed and slimmed down from 15 members to six to improve accountability and decision-making. Late in 2024, it agreed to review our 17 goals; a refreshed set of goals, better reflecting activities across the group and the activities of VHG, Spire OH and LDC, and more integrated with our strategy, will be agreed in 2025.

Strategy in action

## Investing in solar to reduce emissions

During 2024, we began the installation of over 12,000 solar photovoltaic panels at our 38 hospitals across England, Wales and Scotland, as part of our decarbonisation strategy.

makes sound financial sense, but is also a key part of our 10-year carbon reduction roadmap. This substantial investment underscores Spire's dedication in supporting renewable energy sources.

Backed by an investment of £10.2 million in both the panels and building management systems, we expect the solar panels to significantly lower energy consumption and enhance the sustainability of facilities nationwide. We aim to achieve net zero carbon emissions (Scope 1 and 2), and elements of Scope 3 by 2030.

Spire Healthcare was the first independent sector healthcare provider in the UK to commit to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. With energy costs expected to remain high for the foreseeable future, and with our drive to become a recognised leader in sustainability, investing in solar not only

The installation of solar panels was mostly complete at the end of 2024 and will reduce our hospital estate's combined annual carbon footprint by approximately 994 tonnes, the equivalent of:

- planting 39,700 trees, or
- taking 370 medium-sized cars off the road or
- flying from London to Sydney over 220 times

Spire Murrayfield in Wirral was the first Spire hospital to have solar technology installed, with more than 400 panels installed on the roof and in the grounds of the hospital. The 400 panels are expected to generate 15% of the hospital's annual electrical needs.

Overview

Governance report

## Respect the environment

We continually seek ways to reduce the impact our business has on the environment. We have annual carbon emissions targets and are working towards reducing our carbon emissions to meet our 10-year plan to reach net zero by 2030. We also focus our efforts on waste and recycling, including reducing the use of single-use plastics, finding ways to reuse our single-use instruments and reducing the number of disposable gloves we use. We are doing all of this while working with suppliers to align goals, to ensure we work together to develop healthcare in sympathy with a sustainable planet. As an example, in 2024, waste management initiatives saved 2,742 tonnes of CO2 (2023: 358 tonnes). This is equivalent to: 9,475 trees planted each year, or 1,028 cars off the road, or 1,683 houses powered each year.

Our journey towards achieving net zero carbon by 2030 is progressing, and in 2024 we were just short of our target, coming in 6% under our goal. The sustainability committee intend to review all 17 sustainability goals in 2025 and review the net zero plan in light of changing external factors. We have paused our purchase of renewable energy guarantees of origin in 2024 owing to the significant increase in cost. Government policy in supporting the decarbonisation of the National Grid, and degassification of heating systems, will be critical to enable us to achieve our net zero target.

We invested £10.2 million in solar energy and building management systems, and have increased the amount of dry mixed waste we recycle at hospital sites to 31.4% (2023: 23.5%), with most domestic waste now diverted from landfill and used for renewable energy, reused or recycled. All our sites now manage food and glass recycling.

Financial statements

## Engage our people and communities

To deliver our purpose, we need a dedicated and engaged workforce. We aim to provide a stimulating, diverse, inclusive and healthy working environment in which colleagues can thrive and achieve their career goals and aspirations, and so we invest in our workforce through strong recruitment, retention and development programmes.

Our overall median gender pay gap in Spire Healthcare Limited is 11.6% in 2024 (2023: 9.2%) and the mean is 16.2% (2023: 17.7%). Gender pay reflects the structure of our workforce and the differences in the balance of male and female workers within the wider healthcare sector. We understand and value the benefits that diversity can bring across all levels of the organisation. Having a visibly diverse leadership fosters a culture of inclusion that both attracts a broader talent pool, and allows our future talent to recognise that progression is possible to senior leadership roles. We are taking a number of positive steps to invest in, and provide development opportunities for, our female colleagues to progress into senior roles and to help reduce the gender pay gap. These efforts are underpinned by a targeted talent pipeline strategy, designed to identify, develop and support female colleagues at all levels. We are also embedding equity, diversity and inclusion across the group, with active colleague-led networks for sexuality, race and mental health and a new EDI strategy.

Alongside expanding our healthcare services, we also fundraise throughout the year, including during our annual charity drive each summer, during which our teams can choose to support our chosen company charity or a local cause. Our charity drive included bike rides, fun runs, book and cake sales, and walks.

Locally, our teams supported high-profile fundraising events in 2024 such as the Macmillan Cancer Support coffee mornings and Breast Cancer Now's 'Wear it Pink' day, alongside informal local activities. Our dedicated charity committee, which includes representatives from across the business, help design and coordinate our fundraising initiatives and in 2024 introduced 'grants' to support local teams' charity efforts. The committee also began to offer fundraising donations for individuals undertaking personal charity challenges. The committee plans to expand these initiatives in 2025. To promote services to 'hard-to-reach' patient groups, our VHG colleagues work closely with voluntary sector partners to stimulate referrals and bring services to supermarkets, libraries and community centres through a network of partnership liaison officers. They seek to enable equitable access to services, including those who are underrepresented and face additional barriers.

## Operate responsibly

We have a relentless focus on delivering healthcare to the highest standards and prioritise patient safety at all times. We aim to maintain robust standards of clinical and corporate governance in line with best practice, while promoting an open and learning culture for all colleagues. Operating responsibly also requires strict compliance with the law. We continue to monitor all aspects of the group's operations to ensure we comply with all applicable laws, including competition law, anti-bribery law, anti-tax evasion facilitation law, healthcare regulations and data protection law.

## Our goals

## Highlights and priorities

- Develop the group as an innovative integrated healthcare business
- Build new revenue and profit streams by building and acquiring new services, as well as partnering to expand our proposition
- Meet more of Britain's healthcare needs with a broader service

## Highlights of 2024

- Opened three new diagnostic and outpatient clinics in Abergele in north Wales, Harrogate and Norwich
- Won a large new NHS talking therapies contract in Kent and Medway, and a second in Derbyshire to start in 2025
- Won new occupational health contracts, including with a prominent UK retailer
- NHS contracts in Bromley, Oldham, and Basildon and Brentwood were successfully renewed

## Priorities for 2025

- Continue to realise the benefits of an integrated primary and secondary healthcare business to improve our patient offering, experience and pathway
- Harness synergies between acquired primary care services and hospitals to create integrated value
- Expand our national footprint of new diagnostic and outpatient clinics
- Grow our services for corporates to help people stay healthy and safe, and to get back to work

## An integrated healthcare provider

We offer localised care through a combination of primary and secondary healthcare services when and where people need them - including private GP consultations, occupational health, musculoskeletal treatment, and NHS talking therapies services. We aim to care for people in new ways, in new locations and at more stages in their care pathway, and meet more of their healthcare needs.

Our primary care services are tackling the causes of ill health and low productivity, working in partnership with the NHS to care for more people, while offering synergies to our hospital business. More employers or corporates are seeking to support their employees' health and wellbeing, with a preventative approach that addresses health issues before they become a major concern. Early intervention is an increasingly important aspect of healthcare, and we believe Spire Healthcare can make a significant contribution.

## Management structure

As part of our integrated, group-wide approach to healthcare, Derrick Farrell, CEO of Vita Health Group (VHG), has been appointed to lead all our primary care services and now sits on our central executive committee. In 2024, a central management team was formed to run primary care services with work during the year to align cultures and priorities across our new acquisitions from 2022-2024, and with the hospitals business.

Our strategy continued

## Vita Health Group (VHG)

At the heart of our primary care services is VHG, a major provider of mental and physical health services in England. Through this group, we provide NHS outpatient mental health talking therapies, musculoskeletal (MSK) and dermatology services, with operational hubs in London and six regional centres in Bristol, Orpington, Oldham, Leicestershire, Nottingham and Newcastle. Approximately 75% of the business provides care for NHS patients and 25% for patients covered by employer schemes or PMI.

We provide MSK services to NHS, private and corporate patients, and work with over 500 companies to help their workforce stay fit and healthy. Our physical health services range from physiotherapy to exercise classes and treatments, such as acupuncture and injection therapy, while mental health services include cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), guided self-help and group therapy.

NHS talking therapies are effective and confidential treatments for conditions including depression and anxiety. Unlike our hospital services, this area of our business operates through long-term contracts, giving a high degree of revenue visibility. We work with 16 NHS integrated care boards. We also offer counselling services to the corporate and occupational health markets.

The core quality metric for all our services is recovery: whether our patients have recovered to the extent that their issues allow a return to their usual activities. NHS talking therapies are above the national NHS target of 50% at 53.1% for 2024.

In 2024, VHG won and mobilised a new NHS talking therapies contract in Kent and Medway, worth £70 million over the life of the contract. Another was won in Derbyshire which will start in 2025. Contracts in Bromley, Oldham, and Basildon and Brentwood were renewed through 2025 and VHG's financial results are ahead of plan. We continue to push services into new geographies, prioritising areas where we already have a hospital or clinic presence, increasing the opportunity for downstream revenue into hospitals.

Overview

Strategic report

Governance report

In 2025, we will continue to link more VHG services with our digitalisation programme in hospitals and in our customers' journeys, and accelerate hub working, making Spire more efficient so we can continue to deliver on our purpose.

## Spire Mental Health

In 2024, we launched Spire Mental Health, which harnesses the expertise of our experienced and accredited mental health therapists in VHG, to give self-pay patients confidential access to virtual cognitive behavioural therapy and counselling. Patients can gain fast access to treatment and book and pay online without a GP referral.

## Spire Clinics

Our new diagnostic and outpatient day case clinics carry out lower complexity care that doesn't require an overnight stay, enabling us to see patients in the correct setting for their care, and free up space for more complex care, meet the healthcare needs of more people and build relationships with new consultants. Every clinic offers Spire GP services.

We have a pipeline of clinic openings and in 2024, we opened new clinics in Abergele, north Wales, Harrogate and Norwich. The Abergele clinic provides patients with fast access to diagnostic services and treatments such as ophthalmology, dermatology and gynaecology, and works closely with Spire Yale in Wrexham and Spire Wirral. Our new clinics in Harrogate and Norwich opened in December 2024 and offer a variety of services, including a new MRI in Harrogate in early 2025. Patients needing more complex care can be referred to Spire Leeds or Spire Norwich. More than five new clinics are in development.

## Increasing capacity and broadening services

In December, we opened Spire Healthcare Harrogate Clinic to provide day surgery treatments and minor orthopaedic procedures, Spire GP services and X-ray and ultrasound diagnostics.

The clinic will deliver up to 1,500 operations every year to patients who do not require an overnight stay. This £13.5 million investment provides people across North Yorkshire faster access to a range of surgical treatments, as well as the ability to select a consultant and treatment time. People needing more complex care or treatment that requires an overnight stay can be referred to Spire Leeds.

This is an important milestone in broadening our services, providing local people fast access to outstanding personalised care in their own community. Harrogate clinic is part of a network of new clinics to complement our 38 hospitals across England, Scotland and Wales. Spire Abergele Clinic in North Wales opened in March, and our Spire Ella May Barnes Clinic in Norwich welcomed its first patient in early December.

Special focus has been given to ensure the comfort and safety of patients within the warm and inviting environment of Harrogate Clinic. Clinical areas comprise GP and diagnostic suites, a minor procedure area, and a comfortable discharge suite.

Our strategy continued

## Spire Occupational Health

Spire Occupational Health offers services to over 600 corporate clients throughout the UK. We enhance the health, safety and productivity of employees by helping to prevent ill health at work, and proactively supporting mental and physical wellbeing. In 2024 we won new contracts, including one with a prominent UK retailer.

In line with operational focus in our hospitals division, we centralised operations and streamlined processes in 2024. We are focused on maintaining the highest standards of clinical excellence and successfully renewed our SEQOHS accreditation in 2024.

We are actively exploring opportunities for marketplace consolidation, guided by our commitment to identifying the right partnerships at the opportune moment and at the right price. We are also seeking to streamline our offering to corporates in 2025, seeking synergies between Spire Occupational Health and VHG, allowing us to offer advice to employers and employees, and to then care for and provide the right treatment options for that employee as a patient.

## Our private GP services

Our nationwide private GP network has 16 rapidaccess clinics in central and greater London, delivering around 8,000 private GP appointments each month. Offering same-day private GP appointments, our consulting rooms provide health screens, blood tests and other GP services, and provide a seven-day service with a variety of appointment lengths and online options. Three locations relocated to improved premises in 2024 - Kings Cross, Liverpool Street and London Bridge. The trading position for London Doctors Clinic (LDC) still shows a small loss for 2024; improvements in 2025 will result from bringing Spire GP and LDC under a single management structure.

Spire GP is available in all our 38 hospitals, providing patients with 30-minute GP appointments and a fast way to access the diagnoses and treatments we offer in our hospitals.

## Growth and synergies

As we integrate our healthcare offerings, we expect to accelerate the benefits of offering both primary and secondary care services to deliver a more joined-up patient pathway. We have the ability to identify a problem, provide different levels of in and outpatient treatment, carry out potential surgery and restore patients back to health through rehabilitation. For example, we now offer MSK services, covering triage, community-based physiotherapy, pain management and conditioning, through to diagnostic consultantled services, surgical interventions and rehabilitation.

To drive more patients to our primary care services, we are addressing key geographical areas and creating a hub model for local regions, as well as building our virtual service hubs, to ensure we offer a complementary proposition with the right services in the right place. In 2024 we opened new patient support centres in Cardiff and Seaham in Sunderland, in conjunction with an expanded centre in Essex; this will support integration of primary and secondary offerings.

We are identifying good synergies to develop our primary care services, especially in referrals and corporate relationships. Our strategy to grow our primary care services includes:

- Leveraging the combination of our services to provide a group platform for growth, to meet customer demand and create new offerings
- Building an exceptional team and optimising our operations to meet the evolving needs of our patients, while delivering improved overall margins
- Centralising operations and streamlining processes to enhance service delivery and cost savings
- Expanding into new services, notably in MSK
- Exploring opportunities for marketplace consolidation, guided by our commitment to the right partnerships at the opportune moment and at the right price

## Progress in 2024

In 2024, we have invested £10.2 million on installing PV solar panels and building management systems throughout our hospitals estate, reduced our targeted emissions from our baseline year of 2019 by 24%, but have paused our purchase of renewable energy guarantees of origin (REGOs) owing to the significant increase in cost. However, we remain committed to our goal of attaining net zero status by 2030. We welcome the recent announcement by the National Grid to double the transmission capacity of the UK's electricity grid with backing from the UK government. Government policy in supporting the decarbonisation of the National Grid, and degassification of heating systems, will be critical to enable us to achieve our net zero target.

## Our 10-year carbon reduction target

Using 2019 as a base year, we have set ourselves emission reduction targets out to 2030. Our base year emissions were 34,910 tCO2e. The emissions covered by our target reporting include all Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, as well as Scope 3 emissions from air and rail travel. These are the emissions we control (the Spire Healthcare Carbon Footprint).

In 2024, we extended our target reporting boundary to include all our subsidiaries. We have now included emissions in 2024 for Vita Health Group and The Doctors Clinic Group. In accordance with the GHG Protocol we have determined that the structural changes to our organisation have breached our qualitative criterion 'significance threshold' and triggered the need to reset the baseline. Our 2019 base year and all subsequent years' targets have increased with the inclusion of these additional subsidiaries.

In 2024, our emissions were 26,522 tCO 2 e which is a 24% reduction since our 2019 base year. As our interim annual target for 2024 was 24,963 tCO 2 e, our performance was 6.2% adverse to our target.

When targets were set, we had anticipated purchasing REGOs in 2025. With none being procured, due to factors out with our control, electricity targets were difficult to achieve. The market value of REGOs

1.  The trajectory to net zero by 2030 and figures presented here exclude VHG; we will look to integrate our plans going forward.

have been prohibitively high with significant increases in market prices resulting from the exit of the UK from the Europe-wide REGO scheme. It is our long-term objective to use this market-mechanism, but have decided to wait and monitor the markets and in the meantime reinvest in our own renewable projects.

Additionally, during the year we believed we were on track to achieving target until final billing with our energy supplier revealed data inaccuracies. Additionally, Scope 1 transport has increased slightly due to increased business activity.

Despite missing the year-end target, it should be noted that we still reduced emissions from 2023 to 2024 by 1,197 tCO2 e and from the base year 2019, we continue to make good progress, reducing emissions by 8,388 tCO2 e.

We invested significant capital to decarbonise in 2024 and these projects should more fully develop and generate savings into 2025. We are installing solar PV arrays at all our hospital sites. The majority were completed and energised in 2024. Solar power generated on site will displace purchased electricity and therefore related carbon emissions.

Additionally, we are well progressed with upgrading all hospital building management systems (BMS). This will help us improve operational control of our hospitals' heating, ventilation and cooling systems (HVAC). Once again, most hospital sites have been upgraded with the remainder to be completed in early 2025. A rolling programme of LED lighting has continued, which has helped curb electricity emissions.

Piped nitrous oxide has been physically removed from service at all hospitals and our improved reporting accuracy for fluorinated gases has resulted in lower emissions, which has helped mitigate performance elsewhere. The hospitals continue to invest time in energy efficiency projects, using hospital level targets to drive our carbon champions to save energy through communications such as our newsletter, by promoting behavioural change and through small capital projects, complimenting the large capital projects that we have underway.

## Our carbon reduction roadmap

The graph below shows annual targets for emissions reductions as well as actual performance. The targets and baseline now include Vita Health Group and The Doctors Clinic Group. Considering our 2024 performance and the evolving emissions reporting sphere, we have created a new interim target for 2025, to allow us time to review our options for future reporting years. Among consideration is adopting targets that are in line with the Science Base Targets Initiative (SBTi) methodology. We will also review any other best practice for emissions target setting.

Our review has been triggered by REGOs now costing more than initially expected and the cost of degasification not being at the levels anticipated when targets were set in 2020.

Overview

Sustainability report continued

Additionally, our review will increase the scope of our emissions reporting to include our whole GHG inventory and adopt best-practice target setting.

The 2025 target of 25,916 tCO 2 e will ensure we continue to strive for emission reductions from 2024's year-end position of 26,522 tCO 2 e. The 2025 target is for all Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions as well as Scope 3 emissions from air and rail.

## Carbon credits

Our surplus emissions, over target, amount to 1,559 tCO2e. In order to demonstrate our commitment to the avoidance and removal of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions we have purchased credits for this surplus. The project in which we decided to invest is a REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) project in Brazil. This project is certified by Verra through its Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) Program which is the most widely used greenhouse gas (GHG) crediting programme in the world. We are aware that carbon credit programmes have their limitations and will undertake appropriate due diligence prior to engaging in any major use of carbon credits to offset future emissions.

## CDP reporting

We have retained our Climate Disclosure Project (CDP) management level band scoring for the 2024 response. There was a minor drop in the actual scoring to a 'B-' from 2023's 'B'. The questionnaire had a large overhaul in 2024 with many additional questions and sections. We are looking to address gaps in our response to improve scoring in 2025. Several categories within the response improved in scoring such as our Risk Disclosure, Governance and Scope 3 Emissions reporting.

Governance report

## Full GHG inventory and streamlined energy and carbon reporting

This section provides the emissions data and supporting information required by the Companies Act 2006 (strategic report and directors' report) Regulations 2013 and the Companies (directors' report) and Limited Liability Partnerships (energy and carbon report) Regulations 2018.

Total GHG emissions for the Spire Healthcare Group in 2024 were 352,202 tCO2 e. For the first time we are reporting our full GHG inventory with all scopes included (see table opposite). The only notable exception is Scope 3 Category 7: Employee Commuting. From 2025 we will begin to include commuter surveys in our annual questionnaires to allow us to determine emissions from this category.

## Notes on the table

Emissions stated are for all Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions as well as all Scope 3 categories where information is currently available.

## a. Methodology and emissions factors

The Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting Regulation (SECR) report relates to Spire Healthcare Group PLC (and all subsidiaries) and covers the emissions from its operations from January 2024 to December 2024.

The reported carbon emissions have been calculated following the guidance in the UK government's Environmental Reporting Guidelines, 2019, and the methodology outlined in The GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (revised edition). The carbon emission factors have been obtained from the UK government's GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 2024. An 'operational control' methodology has been adopted to outline the scope of carbon emissions reporting for Spire Healthcare; operational control refers to the ability of an organisation to direct the activities of a facility or operation. In the context of GHG reporting, a company is considered to have operational control over a facility or activity if it has the authority to introduce and implement operating policies at that facility or in that activity, regardless of ownership.

Sustainability report continued

This means that the organisation is responsible for the GHG emissions from the 'operations it controls'.

This report includes the material carbon emissions, in line with the emissions categories, as required to be reported under the SECR regulations as well as voluntary emissions from all other sources available.

b. Scope 1: direct emissions from the operation of owned and controlled facilities and equipment Scope 1 emissions are made up by emissions from natural gas, transport, medical gases, gas oil (backup generation) and refrigerants.

## c. Scope 2: indirect emissions from the production of purchased energy

Scope 2 emissions used a location-based methodology in 2024. These emissions are primarily from purchased electricity across our estate. A minor percentage was for the use of battery powered electric vehicles.

## d. Scope 3: indirect emissions from the value chain

Category 1 and 2 emissions have been calculated using spend-based data with Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) conversion factors for the whole group. Additionally, some primary activity data for water supply has also been included. Category 3 emissions are for well-totank for all fuels used, well-to-tank for electricity generation, well-to-tank for transmission and distribution (T&amp;D), and electricity T&amp;D losses.

Category 4 emissions are for the purchase of courier services for incoming goods. Category 5 is for waste generated in operations, coming primarily from waste partners for recycling, combustion and landfill. Some waste data was calculated on a spend-based method for disposals. Category 6 emissions are from air travel, rail travel and hotel stays. Category 9 emissions are for the purchase of courier services for outgoing goods.

From the full inventory it can be seen that Scope 3 emissions dominate. These contribute more than 92.5% of all emissions, with Scope 1 and Scope 2 contributing 4.1% and 3.4% respectively. Scope 1 emissions decreased 6% in comparison to 2023, and Scope 2 emissions decreased by 2%. These are the emissions that we have been proactively targeting for reduction. Emissions from Scope 3 waste performed very well, having decreased by 46%. The rest of our Scope 3 emissions increased, with these mostly being tied directly to spend-based activity data.

As required by SECR legislation we have stated our emissions, 2023's emissions for comparison, an intensity ratio, energy efficiency actions carried out, our methodology and our energy usage. These can be found on page 39-40. Despite our overall emissions increasing our intensity metric has decreased by 0.4% to 231 tCO2 e per £m revenue.

In 2024 we carried out a comprehensive review of our supply chain in our ongoing commitment to environmental sustainability and reducing carbon emissions. As part of this effort, we were seeking to understand better the environmental impact of our suppliers' operations, particularly GHG emissions. The response received will aid us in identifying opportunities for collaboration in reducing emissions across the supply chain.

Our aim for the future is to begin to develop targets for our Scope 3 emissions.

Strategic report

Governance report

## Progress in 2024

Ensuring that we manage our waste properly, and recycle what we can, is vital for a healthcare business. It is all about doing the right thing, contributing to our carbon reduction programme, protecting the environment, and reducing costs.

In the hospitals, we generate a considerable amount of general waste. This is a combination of domestic waste, most of which can be used to generate renewable energy, and dry mixed recycling (DMR), which can be reused or repurposed. The hospitals business also disposes of clinical, infectious and offensive healthcare waste that requires specialist treatment, incineration or disposal through the renewable energy system. The challenge of managing and sorting such complex waste streams is unique to the healthcare sector.

It is important for our teams to understand the various types of waste and we have been rolling out mandatory waste segregation training since 2023. By November 2024, over 10,000 colleagues (2023: 1,300) had been trained. We incinerated less proportionately of total waste (from 29% in 2023 to 25% in 2024), and absolute tonnage has decreased by 11%. However, as incineration prices per tonne have increased, costs have increased in this area.

In 2024, Spire Healthcare's waste management initiatives saved over 2,742 tonnes of CO 2 (2023: 358 tonnes) This is equivalent to:

-   9,475 trees planted each year or
-   1,028 cars off the road or
- 1,683 houses powered each year

Financial statements

Other information

We are now recycling at 49 clinical and non-clinical sites, up from 47 in 2023.

DMR rates improved in 2024 to 31.4% from 23.5% because mandated training is raising awareness of the importance of segregating waste, combined with investment in new waste segregation bins.

Most sites are now segregating disposable curtains and tray wraps. Following a feasibility study for a ' gloves off' campaign with the aim of reducing glove numbers in clinical waste in hospitals, we implemented the initiative successfully in 2024. We also tested the removal or reduction in use of disposable paper tissue roll in many of our outpatient areas and concluded we could implement reduction initiatives safely; we did so from October 2024.

We have 'offensive waste' segregation at all our hospital sites. Disposal of offensive waste costs over 60% less per tonne and uses a more environmentally friendly waste disposal process than clinical or infectious waste. It is not incinerated; instead, it goes to a special materials recovery facility, where it generates renewable energy without releasing

any harmful substances into the atmosphere. By encouraging segregation into offensive waste and clinical waste, we reduced our carbon emissions. In 2024, we continued to push the segregation of clinical and infectious waste into offensive waste by focusing on waste segregation in our theatres.

To help reduce our carbon footprint, the sharps bio system roll out, designed by our waste partner Stericycle, was completed across the estate in 2024. Stericycle's containers are reusable, UN-approved, puncture-resistant containers that can be used up to 600 times after washing and disinfection, as opposed to the single-use sharps containers that are disposed of after just one use.

In 2024, our key focus was the deployment of PV solar panels and building management systems as described on page 39. As these programmes are now materially complete, more action will now be taken in relation to water saving initiatives.

Initial focus will be on the roll out of automated meter reading for all our hospital sites, delivering accurate measurement of water consumption, and to understand the impact of water saving activities. We are in discussion with our advisors and suppliers over this initiative with a view to implementation in 2025.

In the meantime we have continued to make tactical savings, eg identifying and removing low-use outlets. From reviews of our housekeeping and catering processes, we believe further savings in water consumption will be forthcoming in 2025.

## Progress in 2024

Investing in our talented people is a major focus for us, as we seek to train and upskill colleagues, preparing them for a fulfilling and rewarding career at Spire Healthcare or elsewhere in the wider health and care sector.

## Our apprenticeships and people development

Supporting the development of our colleagues is crucial to maintain our high standards of quality and care. Our five-year nursing and allied health professional (AHP) strategy focuses on delivering excellent, safe practice and care and has three strands: developing our workforce, driving clinical excellence through practice and enhancing professional pride.

In 2024, we launched our new Driving Clinical Excellence in Practice programme, which supports the continuing professional development of registered nurses and allied health professionals; 350 colleagues have started it. The programme considers clinical skills and competencies, and meaningful subject matters within healthcare.

Professional development is an important part of our offer to attract and retain the best people to work in our hospitals and clinics. We seek to refresh colleagues' competencies and skills regularly. Clinical competencies will be part of our new automated online learning management system for mandatory training, launching in 2025. The new platform will not only reduce risk by ensuring that compliance and mandatory training is appropriately delivered, but also allow colleagues to drive their own development when it is launched in 2025.

In 2024, over 110 apprentices graduated from our apprenticeship programmes, including many who achieved functional skills in maths and English to be able to participate in higher level programmes. We give them the right environment in which to thrive, study and learn. We continue to sustain a healthy pipeline of new apprentices enrolling in our programmes, and closely monitor performance against retention and career progression data.

Our largest apprenticeship programme is the Registered Nurse Degree, and our apprentices continued their studies in 2024 with the University of Sunderland and in placements in a range of nursing settings. Nurse graduates deliver critically needed nursing skills directly into the UK's healthcare sector. We currently have over 380 apprentices across the group in a wide range of clinical areas such as laboratory medicine, physiotherapy, pharmacy, theatres, as well as non-clinical disciplines such as engineering, governance and hospitality, and in Vita Health Group, representing around 3% of our permanent workforce.

We offer a range of opportunities to help colleagues learn and grow at work. In 2024, we continued to focus on developing manager capability, including the introduction of a new managers programme where more than 100 managers with less than six months' experience learned the fundamental skills for great people management.

In Vita Health Group, a mentoring scheme in 2024 supported 56% of participants to advance in their career. A new induction process for joining colleagues was introduced in 2024 to manage the training at a more manageable pace.

Governance report

## Progress in 2024

We have reviewed this goal in line with the requirements of the Parker Review: 'Improving the Ethnic Diversity of Business', published in 2023, to assess how best to support diversity in the business. At the end of 2024, we agreed a target of 18% ethnic minority representation within executive committee and their direct reports.

Diversity remains vital to our success, and our equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) strategy was reviewed in 2024 with a view to defining organisation-level targets to help us improve diversity and belonging within the business.

We were pleased to be listed in the Financial Times Diversity Leaders index for another year; an index of companies considered to be Europe's diversity leaders, based on a survey of 100,000 employees across Europe. We aspire to create an environment where everyone is respected and where difference is celebrated.

The group's executive committee demographic was 22% ethnically diverse in 2024 (2023: 25%) and the board is 10% ethnically diverse, up from 8% in 2023. For executive committee and their direct reports, the proportion was 9.2% ethnically diverse (2023: 7.8%).

## Colleague networks

We have networks supported by a member of the executive committee to give focus and impetus. All networks contribute to policy and inclusion.

Our race equality network is a supportive and confidential colleague network that provides individuals from diverse backgrounds with a safe and open platform to share their personal experiences. The network has been active with regular meetings and communications updating colleagues on actions taken and celebrating successes. Regular catering events encourage embracing diverse cultures and backgrounds.

Our menopause network completed a second survey in 2024, which showed an improvement in awareness of menopause and symptoms among colleagues and knowledge of the menopause policy. Comments showed a need for training to support line managers' understanding of symptoms and each person's

Other information experience; we have released an awareness booklet and now offer additional health benefits for permanent employees. We have also trialled an alternative gender-free uniform, which can be worn by anyone.

The LGBTQ+ network is colleague-led and offers support, training and celebration, and contributes to group policy formation. In early 2025, the network was awarded 'highly commended' by the Metro Pride Awards as in the LGBT+ best colleague network category, for strengthening organisation culture.

VHG has networks on women, LGBTQIA+ and race equality, presenting safe spaces for those communities. Each network is involved in setting policies for the business.

## Understanding our workforce better

Colleagues are encouraged to share their ethnicity during the annual colleague survey to help Spire Healthcare better understand the different experiences of colleagues. The survey results are reported and shared across the hospitals business, including the responses to questions on reporting instances of harassment, bullying, or abuse at work from patients, managers, and colleagues. The survey also asks whether colleagues believe that Spire Healthcare provides equal career progression and promotion opportunities, regardless of factors such as ethnic background, gender, religion, sexual orientation, disability or age.

Of those colleagues in Spire Healthcare Limited who disclose their ethnicity, 20.4% report having a non-white background, up from 18.9% in 2023.

VHG has positive action schemes in place to reduce barriers to employment faced by people with disabilities, women, veterans and those from ethnic minority backgrounds. The schemes guarantee interviews for those applicants who meet the role criteria. Colleagues have also been offered a wide variety of training including, anti-racism, disability awareness and LGBTQIA+ awareness.

## Progress in 2024

Spire Healthcare is committed to diversity and inclusion, which includes supporting women to become leaders within the business.

We have five women on the board, equal to 50% of the membership, in 2024, up from 45% in 2023, reflecting our commitment to fair representation across the business. The board considers its members' diversity regularly through data reviews, recruitment decisions and discussions in board meetings. Diversity is also regularly reviewed as part of the workforce demographics discussions at meetings of the remuneration committee and executive committee.

Our executive committee demographic was 33% female in 2024 (2023: 38%).

The combined board and executive committee demographic in 2024 is 47% female, level with 2023.

Spire Healthcare is 4th in the FTSE 250, and first in healthcare, for women in senior leadership positions, as recognised by the FTSE Women Leaders Review report for 2024/25 which covers the largest UK companies. Our executive committee combined with our senior managers - their direct reports - was 55% female at 31 October 2024 (2023: 58%), as reported to the review.

## Progress in 2024

Our main employing entity is Spire Healthcare Limited - covering 83.8% of all reportable employees of Spire Healthcare Group. In the interests of transparency, we have provided additional data that captures relevant employees across the Spire Healthcare Group.

Gender pay reflects the structure of our workforce and the differences in the balance of male and female workers within the wider healthcare sector. Gender pay is distinct from 'equal pay', which considers whether men and women are paid the same for carrying out the same or equivalent roles.

In 2024, the overall median gender pay gap in Spire Healthcare Limited was 11.6% (2023: 9.2%) and the mean reduced to 16.2% compared to 17.7% in 2023.

The median gender pay gap in Spire Healthcare Group was 12.3% for 2024 (2023: 9.1%) which is below the Office for National Statistics median of 13.1% published in October 2024. The mean gender pay gap for Spire Healthcare Group reduced to 16.1% from 17.2% in 2023.

Our mean and median gender bonus gap reduced in 2024 compared to 2023 for Spire Healthcare Limited and Spire Healthcare Group. For Spire Healthcare Limited the mean gender bonus gap for 2024 was 74.7% compared to 82.0% in 2023 and the median gender bonus gap was 25% from 50% in 2023. For Spire Healthcare Group the mean gender bonus gap for 2024 was 76.2% compared to 81.7% in 2023 and the median gender bonus gap was 25% from 50% in 2023.

## Responding to the gender pay gap

We understand and value the benefits that diversity can bring across all levels of the organisation. Having a visibly diverse leadership fosters a culture of inclusion that both attracts a broader talent pool and also allows our future talent to recognise that progression is possible to senior leadership roles.

We have made a focused effort to better understand our gender data across all levels within our organisation and where we have either weak or strong levels of gender balance in the talent pipeline. In addition we have been reviewing, updating and creating new policies (for example menopause policy) that can support all women in our workforce. This has been a conscious effort to both attract and retain our female talent.

The introduction of the job framework for hospital colleagues has provided clarity on progression pathways, enabling better flow and retention of female talent. These efforts are underpinned by a targeted talent pipeline strategy, designed to identify, develop and support female colleagues at all levels.

In addition, 2024 was the second successful year of insourcing our recruitment which has significantly reduced vacancies and time to hire, allowing even more focus on the right candidates for roles and will help focus on gender and diversity representation.

We continue to undertake talent and succession planning where we look to create opportunities and support the development of female leaders.

We continue to invest in colleague development and training, focusing particularly on management and leadership capabilities. In 2024 representation was gender balanced across our executive coaching programme.

## Progress in 2024

We want our colleagues to have a great work experience, and if they feel engaged, they can perform at their best. Regular communication is an important part of our engagement activities and we use a variety of communication channels to provide regular updates on all aspects of our hospitals business.

We aim to make it easy for frontline hospital colleagues without regular access to email to get involved in our communication and engagement activities. Our colleague communications app (provided by Ryalto) is available for colleagues to access on their own personal devices to stay connected easily. The app is an excellent platform to recognise teams and individuals. In 2024 we published key information in a variety of formats including photos and animations, as well as videos from our chief executive officer and the executive committee.

In 2024, we introduced Microsoft Viva Engage in the hospitals business, a key communication and collaboration tool. Following a pilot in the summer with senior leaders, we successfully launched Viva Engage into Spire Leeds and Spire Yale hospitals, set up a company newsfeed and launched to two central functions teams. Integrated as part of the Microsoft 365 suite of applications and available on personal devices and computers, Viva Engage will build upon the success of Ryalto and make it easier for colleagues to interact across different communities that represent local teams, role type and personal interests.

We encourage regular feedback from colleagues, with annual surveys to gain in-depth feedback across the group. We held our group-wide colleague surveys in November, with colleagues in hospitals, central functions, LDC and Spire Occupational Health completing the same survey*. For the first time, VHG aligned the timing of its survey and introduced new questions to provide important year-on-year comparisons, and group-wide indicators.

<!-- image -->

Results for the hospitals business showed an overall response rate of 83% (86% in 2023), with 76% of colleagues saying they are proud to work for the business (81% in 2023), and 83% would be happy with the standard of care if their friends or family needed treatment (86% in 2023).

Results for VHG showed an engagement score of 78% (2023: 81%) with a response rate of 82% (2023: 80%).

In March, we held a colleague survey champions day for the hospitals business with a focus on understanding the drivers behind the key themes from the 2023 colleague survey, ideas for action plans and how to drive meaningful change. The year's key themes included recognition and trust in leadership, celebrating differences and recommending Spire as a place to work. Since its last survey, VHG has followed up to understand their scores and seek improvements.

We focused on four main themes from a safety survey of hospitals business colleagues in 2024, related to accessing the patient safety policy, speaking up, feedback and behaviour. This survey was linked to the chief executive's 'Listen Up' theme for the year and sought to gain more insight into this important area, supporting an open culture where people feel comfortable to speak up. The findings show that there is opportunity for focus and for us to question ourselves 'how do we get better?'. We are also analysing possible reasons why some hospitals appear to be making greater progress than others and will share learning in committee reports.

Line managers conduct regular one:one meetings and full and half-year reviews. Our executive committee and non-executive directors dedicate quality time to people issues across the group, and continued to engage with colleagues over 2024 through the workforce committee and colleague listening sessions at sites across the country.

## Progress in 2024

## Contributing to our communities

We believe in the power of giving back to our local communities and making a positive impact on society. In 2023, Spire Healthcare established a group-wide charity committee to coordinate, consider and agree the group's overall charitable initiatives. The committee is chaired by a member of the executive committee with participants from across the organisation. In 2024, the committee held a strategy day and agreed to start pledging grants to sites and individuals who are fundraising. The committee agrees the level of grant or donation - for the latter, individuals must raise at least the amount donated by Spire.

During our annual corporate charity drive in June, hospitals raised £7,000 for Maggie's, the cancer charity, and the business donated an additional £10,000. In addition, hospitals took part in local fundraising for more than 25 different worthy causes - activities included a charity bike ride, a fun run and baking. Colleagues sought to live out the objectives of being kind, making a positive difference to worthy causes and having some fun along the way.

As well as supporting national charities such as Maggie's, many hospitals strengthened their relationships with local charities and organisations in their communities throughout the year. These charities, which are chosen by our colleagues, closely reflect the communities they serve, and the support goes beyond fundraising. The relationships are often long-standing and we offer them valuable resource, locations for meetings and events, workplace experience, and publicity where possible.

Other information

Christmas was a particularly active time in 2024. Spire Bushey Hospital was delighted to provide its annual Christmas lunch to the Over 60's club in a local church, an event which has been ongoing for over 30 years; the hospital catering team produced a fantastic meal with all the trimmings. Spire Liverpool's colleagues and consultants donated gifts for the Cash for Kids appeal, doubling their 2023 collection. The charity works with disadvantaged children from birth to 18. Spire Cardiff colleagues donated 90 gift bags to a south Wales charity for underprivileged children, the Mr X Appeal, and raised over £1,000 for the Welsh Air Ambulance.

Earlier in the year, Spire Parkway raised over £10,000 for Cancer Research UK's Race for Life. Over 50 colleagues took part in the a muddy obstacle course in Birmingham, some of whom have, themselves, been affected by cancer.

To promote services to 'hard-to-reach' patient groups, Vita Health Group's partnership liaison officers work closely with voluntary sector partners to stimulate referrals and bring services to locations such as supermarkets, libraries and community centres. In 2024, they engaged with local community partners and voluntary organisations to better understand patient groups to improve access and outcomes. In 2024, a project began to prepare for the patient carer race equality framework, which comes into force in March 2025 for all providers of mental health services for NHS patients.

At Vita Health Group, each colleague can take one volunteer day per year; this was little used in 2023 but in 2024 over 80 days were taken, giving time to local communities.

## Progress in 2024

Quality underpins everything we do. We have robust ward-to-board governance and internal audit procedures, and members of the board and executive committee regularly visit and meet with hospital leaders, colleagues, consultants and medical advisory committees.

We expect the highest possible standards every day across all locations, delivering care and providing safety to patients. Currently 98% of our inspected hospital sites are rated 'Good', 'Outstanding' or the equivalent by health inspectors in England, Scotland and Wales. Both hospitals in Edinburgh and Spire Clare Park in Farnham were rated 'Good' overall in 2024. We are still awaiting reinspection of Spire Alexandra in Kent which has not been inspected by the Care Quality Commission since 2016/17.

100% of Vita Health Group locations inspected by CQC are rated 'Good'.

## Progress in 2024

We constantly seek to improve our standards of clinical and corporate governance, as quality sits at the heart of our culture. Our Quality Improvement (QI) strategy is now fully embedded across the organisation, while our non-executive directors conduct regular hospital visits, meet with hospital leaders, and attend local medical advisory boards and national conferences.

In 2024 we implemented the Patient Safety Incident Response Framework (PSIRF), which promotes an improved approach to responding to patient safety incidents. It recommends a system-based approach to learning, with supportive oversight of consultants focused on strengthening our response systems and continuous improvement. We have linked PSIRF to our QI programme and Freedom to Speak Up efforts to seek lasting learning and sustain a learning and open culture. This promotes colleague and patient engagement, and improved relationships.

We continue to actively contribute data to relevant registries such as the National Joint Registry (NJR) in 2024. In 2024, 35 Spire hospitals achieved the Quality Data Provider certificate, with 25 receiving the 'gold' award (2023: 31 and 19). Of 16 chemotherapy units, 15 are recognised with the Macmillan Quality Environment Mark (MQEM) accreditation (2023: 15) and we have 14 hospitals with accreditation by the Joint Advisory Group on endoscopy (2023:14)

In 2024, we remain fully compliant with the Independent Healthcare Providers Network's (IHPN) Medical Practitioners Assurance Framework (MPAF).

We welcome PSIRF, as the framework not only helps us manage professional standards, but also builds on our open and learning culture.

We work hard to create a culture that is characterised by openness, respect, collaborative working, a focus on clinical safety, and a spirit of continuous improvement. Attracting, retaining and developing great people is a high priority for us, and we can only do this if colleagues feel valued, rewarded, motivated, and supported by clearly defined career paths.

We continue to encourage our colleagues and consultant partners to speak up if they see something that's wrong, and we will always listen to them and support them. We have Freedom to Speak Up Guardians at all sites, and available for colleagues who work remotely, to whom colleagues can turn.

## Further develop our approach to controls around modern slavery

## Initiatives

- Reviewed third-party risk management solution
- Continued supplier and product rationalisation initiatives

<!-- image -->

16

<!-- image -->

## Progress in 2024

Spire Healthcare Group is committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all our relationships, in line with our value of 'Doing the right thing'. Our approach to tackling the risk of modern slavery continues to evolve under the oversight of our sustainability committee, which reports to our executive committee to ensure that our directors have full oversight on all relevant matters.

Our two main areas of focus are: a) to safeguard patients, colleagues and others who come through our facilities; and b) in our supply chain. In our business operations, we believe practitioners and colleagues are well-placed to identify and deal with modern slavery concerns through the safeguarding training and protections we have in place. The safeguarding system trains those practitioners and other colleagues (clinical and non-clinical) to recognise and report signs of abuse. We believe the rigour of this system mitigates the risk of modern slavery from either going undetected or being dealt with inadequately. This risk is further controlled by the support, training and infrastructure in place for all colleagues to be able to raise concerns through our network of Freedom to Speak Up Guardians, or other available channels. In 2024, we:

- Maintained our modern slavery due diligence process for new suppliers with an annual spend in excess of £1 million. There were no issues identified through this process
- Continued to apply our procurement policy, which ensures that our hospitals and clinics are equipped with guidance and a risk assessment tool for evaluating modern slavery risks in local contracts
- Continued supplier and product rationalisation initiatives, focusing our attention on increasing the proportion of spend with long-standing reputable suppliers, with whom satisfactory due diligence has been carried out
- Reviewed the merits of procuring a third-party supplier risk management solution and determined, at this stage, not to progress further as we considered our internal processes to be adequate

Governance report

## Progress in 2024

In 2024, we made significant strides in enhancing our cybersecurity posture, focusing on people, processes and technology to mitigate risk and strengthen information governance.

Robust security foundation: we successfully transitioned to the updated ISO27001:2022 standard, demonstrating our commitment to best-practice security management. We also maintain cyber essentials plus certification and full compliance with NHS data security and protection requirements.

Proactive risk management: we conducted independent security reviews and audits, leveraging industry-leading partners, to proactively identify and address potential vulnerabilities. We continuously benchmark our performance using the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) framework, ensuring alignment with industry best practices.

Enhanced governance and oversight: the data strategy, governance and security committee provides robust oversight of our cybersecurity programme, reporting regularly to the audit and risk committee. This cross-functional committee ensures comprehensive consideration of data and security matters across the hospitals business.

Strategic technology investments: we deployed enterprise-grade security platforms and fully leveraged the advanced security capabilities within the Microsoft 365 suite, significantly enhancing our protection against sophisticated cyber threats.

Strengthened expertise: our internal cybersecurity team was expanded with experienced professionals, including the appointment of a group chief information security officer (CISO), and we established a cyber risk retainer with specialised threat intelligence experts. This combination strengthens our proactive threat detection, incident response and overall security posture to bring alignment and consistency for information security.

Proactive threat intelligence: we actively monitor threat intelligence from multiple sources, enabling us to anticipate and respond effectively to emerging cyber risks.

The strategy covers Spire Healthcare Limited only at this stage; we are working to bring the rest of the group under the same security governance.

Engagement with stakeholders continued

## Patients

Responsible executive owner Group clinical director

## Who they are and how we engage

## Who they are

We treat a wide variety of patients who self-pay, with PMI, those referred through the NHS and those funded by corporates.

## Why they are important to us

Providing the highest quality, safe, personalised care to our patients is at the core of everything we do.

## What is important to them

Rapid access to high-quality healthcare, assessment, advice, diagnosis and treatment, at a price they can afford.

## How we engage

We engage continuously with patients before, during and after their treatment and seek to involve them in all key decisions about their care.

We use a framework of customer and patient surveys, including questions mandated by regulation (eg Private Healthcare Information Network) or contracts (eg NHS). These cover our major touchpoints with patients, whether they receive admitted care or come to us as outpatients.

We work closely with patients, with the support of The Patients Association, on a range of projects, to understand their experience of care with us, and we use their feedback to further shape and refine our processes. We run hospital patient forums and conduct regular director and board level site visits.

## Board engagement

While we review the feedback from our patient engagement locally in our hospitals and clinics and as part of our operational reviews, we also do this through the board's clinical governance and safety committee. This helps us develop and continuously improve the services we provide to patients, as well as define our annual quality priorities, which we set out in our annual Quality Account to the NHS.

## Consultants

## Responsible executive owner

Group medical director

## Who they are and how we engage

## Who they are

We work with 8,740 consultants, who operate as self-employed practitioners in our business. They are experts in their fields, drawn from all medical disciplines, who are granted privileges to practise in our hospitals, in line with our stringent medical governance procedures.

## Why they are important to us

Our consultants are integral to providing high levels of medical care to our patients.

## What is important to them

High-quality facilities, continuity of trained, committed employees providing support to help them establish and develop an efficient practice at our sites, and the quality of care that we provide to patients.

## How we engage

We meet with consultants to plan individual procedures, understand their future needs and horizon scan for developing clinical innovation. They are invited to complete an annual feedback survey. In addition, each hospital has its own medical advisory committee (MAC) to advise the hospital director and the director of clinical services on any matter relating to the proper, safe, efficient and ethical medical and dental use of the hospital; they meet quarterly. Each medical specialty is represented. Topics including clinical quality, learning from concerns, incidents and complaints are discussed, plus feedback from members about matters concerning consultants. MACs are governed by standard terms of reference, and all discuss the same key items using a standard agenda. The medical director and associate medical directors attend MACs at hospitals, with the aim of attending all MACs at least annually. In addition, hospitals hold an AGM for their whole medical society, to which all consultants are invited. MAC chairs run performance appraisals for each consultant.

## Board engagement

Feedback from our annual survey is reviewed by the board's clinical governance and safety committee and we use this to enhance the offer we provide to consultants. Board and executive committee members visit regularly to listen, learn and guide and there are biannual reviews with hospital directors.

## Sentiment

- 84% of consultants say care provided in hospitals is 'very good' or 'excellent', up from 83% in 2023

Responsible executive owner Chief operating officer

## Who they are and how we engage

## Who they are

We work with a diverse range of organisations which supply the group with everything from medicines, equipment, services and food to people.

## Why they are important to us

A reliable and effective supply chain is vital to us being able to carry out medical treatment and run the business. In an increasingly volatile environment, resulting from rising inflation and international conflicts, the existence of a reliable and effective supply chain was particularly important during 2024.

## What is important to them

Clear policies, contracts and a strong relationship to ensure long-term and mutually beneficial commercial arrangements.

## Who they are

Private Medical Insurers (PMI) provide medical insurance cover for both employees and individual members.

## Why they are important to us

We have contracted relationships with all the major PMIs in the market. PMIs are a core part of our private business, representing around 45% of our hospital and clinic revenues.

## What is important to them

The need to provide their members with prompt access to leading consultants, facilities and clinical teams with a strong track record on safety, quality and patient satisfaction. The move to digital booking channels and integration is now of increasing importance.

## NHS and government

Responsible executive owner Chief executive officer

## Who they are and how we engage

## Who they are

Within central government, we work closely with the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC). We liaise closely with the NHS; we work with NHS England, Integrated Care Boards, local NHS trusts (and the equivalent in Scotland and Wales), and central NHS teams.

## Why they are important to us

The government sets the political and regulatory environment in which we operate and overall NHS policy towards the independent sector. The NHS is a large customer, as we provide care for NHS patients, either through referrals, commissioning or contracts.

## What is important to them

Our ability to provide high-quality, planned care for NHS patients, helping them to address waiting times and relieving pressure on NHS services.

## How we engage

Our local leadership teams maintain their well-established relationships with NHS counterparts. As well as holding regular meetings, local NHS leaders visit our hospitals, to ensure they understand the capability we have and the services we offer. Our national leadership team maintains relationships with NHS central teams in England, Scotland and Wales. We have relationships with various DHSC and NHS England officials covering a range of portfolios and fed views into the government's new agreement with the independent sector and other issues through the Independent Healthcare Providers Network (IHPN).

Through Vita Health Group, we bid for NHS talking therapy and MSK contracts in England through central tendering processes. VHG has regular engagement with commissioners and the local health system where contracts are held.

## GPs

## Responsible executive owner

Group medical director Chief commercial officer

## Who they are and how we engage

## Who they are

GPs treat all common medical conditions and refer patients to hospitals and other medical services for urgent and specialist treatment.

## Why they are important to us

GPs are a critical part of our referral network, as most patients are referred to us by their NHS GP. For that reason, we seek to liaise closely with them. We are also seeing more patients self-refer. We have invested in a network of primary healthcare relationship managers available to all hospitals; these provide the key link with GPs and deliver training, education and information.

We also offer our own private GP services, Spire GP and London Doctors Clinic (LDC). They are a network of GPs, who are granted privileges to operate in our hospitals, in the same way as consultants, or are directly employed by, or contract with, LDC.

## What is important to them

An understanding of our business and services, to make it easier for them to refer patients to us. They value a high-quality environment, suitable for consulting with patients.

## How we engage

Our hospitals offer regular educational events which support the continuing professional development of NHS GPs which have been extended to include the LDC GPs. Hospital colleagues also provide educational events on site at NHS GP practices. We use the feedback that we receive to organise future events that are tailored to their ongoing needs.

## Board engagement

Some of our board members are experienced medical practitioners and liaise with NHS GPs through medical forums and conferences.

## Sentiment

- For our private GP network, they value the ability to achieve a portfolio career across the independent and NHS sectors
- 79% of respondents to the colleague engagement survey (LDC GPs colleagues) get personal satisfaction from their work (2023: 89%)
- NHS GPs value the relationship between their practice staff and our consultants

- Close relationships with NHS GPs and electronic referral system (eRS) as a major form of referrals
- Capacity at all sites is constantly reviewed and new consultants engaged to increase capacity to meet demand

## Corporates

## Responsible executive owner

Chief commercial officer

## Who they are and how we engage

## Who they are

Corporates are the customers for our occupational health and employee assistance programmes, along with musculoskeletal and mental health services across Spire Occupational Health and Vita Health Group. Meanwhile, more corporates are providing PMI for their employees, who subsequently come to us to receive care.

## Why they are important to us

We deliver care to employees, but the care is purchased by the corporate employer as a package to support occupational health and wellbeing, to prevent ill-health, stress reduction, health intervention, education and self-help. Therefore the corporate is our client and we seek to support their employees' health and wellbeing.

## What is important to them

The need to provide their employees with access to leading advice, clinicians, facilities, locations and virtual services with a strong track record on safety, quality, patient satisfaction and good quality clinical advice and outcomes, to enable people to be healthy and productive and to stay in or get back to work.

## How we engage

Account managers regularly engage with corporates who hold occupational health or employee assistance programme contracts, or both, to discuss current and future requirements and where bespoke services may be developed. Corporates hold contracts with us for mental and physical health on an annual or pay-as-you-go basis. We work with business leaders and their human resources, health and safety colleagues, wellbeing champions, preventative service teams and training departments to engage on the best mix of support for varied workforces and  types of employer.

## Board engagement

The board supports management as needed in their relationships with corporate customers.

## Sentiment

- Clients appreciate transparent, responsive and consistent communication, being made aware of market trends and business updates and changes in legislation
- Contract holders feel prepared for upcoming legislation changes and pleased with the support provided, both proactive and included in contracts
- Growing need for mental and physical support owing to rising population ill-health makes corporates amenable to purchase our services: 47% of occupational health referrals are mental health or musculoskeletal related

## Areas of interest

## Action/outcomes

- Poor employer understanding of what occupational health can achieve, how to access services or how best to use their contract, but a growing willingness to learn
- Need for specialist services to address trauma, stress, substance abuse, neurodiversity, menopause and mental health first aid
- Request for support on new legislation on sexual

Engagement with stakeholders continued

## Regulators

Responsible executive owner Group clinical director

## Who they are and how we engage

## Who they are

We are required to engage with a range of financial, clinical, health and safety, and competition and market regulators.

The principal healthcare regulators we engage with are the Care Quality Commission (CQC), the Healthcare Inspectorate Wales (HIW) and Healthcare Improvement Scotland (HIS). Safe Effective Quality Occupational Health Service (SEQOHS) accredits occupational health services.

## Why they are important to us

Each of our hospitals and clinics, and some VHG sites, are required to be registered with the relevant national healthcare regulator in order to be authorised to offer services to patients.

## What is important to them

Compliance with the law and all relevant regulations.

## How we engage

We have regular dialogue with the healthcare regulators nationally, with good relationships with the group clinical director. Recent changes made by CQC have removed local relationship owners at the hospital level, but these may be reinstated in 2025. Our hospitals have focused on contact with inspection teams pre, during and post formal inspections. Individual locations draw up and implement improvement plans on the basis of feedback from regulators.

We have regular calls with CQC, HIW and HIS to understand the changing face of regulation, and to provide assurance to the regulators of action being taken to maintain and improve safety and quality, and share good practice. For other regulators, such as the Competition and Markets Authority, we have a dedicated legal team who, with external counsel, monitor and advise the group on legal and regulatory developments. Spire Occupational Health works closely with SEQOHS regarding accreditation.

## Board engagement

The board supports management with assurance of effective ward-to-board governance processes and reviews collated feedback from regulators to identify trends and drive responses.

## Risk management and internal control

## Responsibility for risk management and internal control systems lies with the board of directors.'

The board has a consolidated view of key risks from across Spire Healthcare. Our risk management and internal control processes are managed through the audit and risk committee (ARC) in association with the clinical governance and safety committee (CGSC).

## Risk management

The risk management framework (shown diagrammatically on page 68) is designed to identify, evaluate and mitigate the risks that we face at all levels. All significant risks are recorded on our risk management system.

We have reviewed a range of potential emerging risks and their possible impact on Spire Healthcare, using internal and external sources of emerging risk information, for example:

- The University of Cambridge Judge Business School Centre for Risk Studies' taxonomy of business risk
- The UK government's national risk register
- The World Economic Forum's annual risk assessment

We use the risk register to manage all significant risks facing Spire Healthcare by assessing risk in terms of consequence and likelihood. Our risk management methodology captures the assessment of risk on a 'current' or 'net' basis, after existing controls are considered. The detailed registers also include management actions to further reduce risk exposures when considered necessary. In the case of the principal risks, sources of assurance over mitigation of the risks are also reported to the ARC. Reporting of risk within our management information (eg, to the executive committee and ARC), is on a current basis, and the importance of each risk as presented in this report is on the current basis. The relative exposures from the principal risks to Spire Healthcare are shown on page 66.

All risks have an identified risk lead in charge of monitoring and mitigating the risk. Management reviews risk registers in line with the risk management policy at intervals of one, three or six months or when there is imminent change in the risk environment such as legislation.

## Current risk environment

We believed the geopolitical risks in 2024 would be volatile, and they have proven to be with escalation of conflicts in the middle east and Europe and several countries experiencing political instability (eg Germany, France and South Korea), although election results have had clear outcomes in the UK and USA. Despite increased risks of disruption, our supply chains remained resilient, and we have not experienced any major disruption to date.

Looking ahead to 2025, we believe the international geopolitical environment remains volatile, while domestically the economy will experience modest growth. The Bank of England's November 2024 Monetary Policy Report (published ahead of the budget) reported external forecasters' expectations of GDP growth averaging 1.6% in 2025-27, with unemployment and CPI broadly steady at 4.1% and 2.1% respectively. The rise in national insurance and minimum wage announced in the budget, and the pay awards in the NHS will have an impact on our cost base as highlighted in principal risk 'inflation and wage inflation' on page 69.

## Risk appetite

While we make every effort to ensure that all risks are as low as reasonably achievable, it is not possible to reduce all risks to zero. Decisions must therefore be made as to whether the benefits and best use of resources outweigh the risks.

We define our risk appetite as the amount of risk we are prepared to accept, tolerate, or be exposed to at any time. We are committed to doing everything reasonably possible to reduce risk for all patients and to deliver high-quality, efficient and effective care. We are uncompromising on patient safety relating to our clinical service delivery. The lowest risk appetite applies to all safety and compliance objectives, including preventable patient harm, and public and employee health and safety. We have a higher risk appetite for the pursuit of innovation and our strategic and operational objectives. This means meeting legal and other regulatory obligations will take priority over other business objectives.

We apply the following definitions to our risk appetite for the strategic principal risks:

- VL Very low: A high level of risk mitigation or risk avoidance representing the safest strategic route available
- L Low: Seeking to integrate sufficient control and mitigation methods to accommodate a low level of risk
- B Balanced: An approach that brings a high chance for success, considering the risks, along with reasonable rewards, economic and otherwise
- H High: Willing to consider bolder opportunities with higher levels of risk in exchange for increased business payoffs
- VH Very high: Pursuing high-risk, unproven options that carry with them the potential for high-level rewards

The risk appetite for each principal risk is shown on pages 69 to 76 in the detailed risk descriptions.

## Principal risks outside of risk appetite

There are no principal risks outside of our risk appetite.

## Material change to our risk profile from 2023

During the course of 2024, we regularly reviewed our principal risks and made the following changes as reported in our interim financial statements:

- Sub-divided the principal risk 'information governance and security' into its constituent parts of data protection (renamed from information governance) and cyber security (see below)
- Reclassified the PMI and self-pay market dynamic risks into a private market dynamic risk (see below) and described a separate NHS market dynamic risk that was previously included in government and NHS policy
- Inflation and wage inflation risk has increased following the increases in employer's national insurance contributions and minimum wage announced in the 2024 autumn budget
- Supply chain disruption risk we judge to be increasing in light of current geopolitical tensions
- Workforce risk has decreased as a result of lower staff churn rates and lower vacancy rates (see page 75)

In recognition of the scale of the digitalisation programme, we now report a principal risk of organisational transformation.

## Inter-relationships of principal risks

We recognise the strong inter-relationships between the principal risks. The risks that would have the most material impact on other principal risks are:

- Clinical quality
- Inflation and wage inflation
- Cyber security

## Emerging risks

The board considers emerging risks to be those with the following characteristics:

- Any manifestation of the risk is most likely outside of the normal strategic planning horizon of five years
- Are risks for which we have little or no prior experience because of their novelty or highly uncertain nature
- There are no practical control measures that can be taken now but a longer-term strategic response may be appropriate

The emerging risk process is as follows:

- The executive committee prepares an annual analysis of long-term global trends that may lead to emerging risks and opportunities
- It then recommends specific long-term risks to be added to an emerging risk register for monitoring and consideration in our strategic planning process
- The board, via the audit and risk committee, reviews and approves the potential emerging risks and opportunities that the executive committee is monitoring

## Risk management and internal control continued

## Internal controls

## 1) Standard policies and procedures

We have documented policies and standard procedures in place covering all significant activities and areas of risk, which are subject to regular review and update by the policy approval committee (PAC) comprising a cross functional membership of subject matter experts. The PAC reports into the safety, quality and risk committee. The PAC meets eleven times a year and publishes updates to policies on our intranet. All policies are required to follow a standard process for creation and review. There is a standard structure for procedures and guidelines to provide our colleagues and consultants with further operational detail for policies where required. The default review period once a policy is approved is three years but can be shorter if required. There are certain policies that the board reserves the right to approve, for example treasury management, raising concerns and risk management policies.

## 2) Assurance over clinical delivery and clinical regulatory compliance risks

As a provider of clinical services to patients, we face a specific set of non-financial risks associated with such provision. We have strong control structures as described below.

- The group medical director oversees the governance of the medical professional standards of 8,740 consultants through the medical professional standards committee, the management of patient reviews and recalls, the processes for the management of practising privileges and setting medical governance policy
- The integrated quality governance team supports a suite of clinical audits which assess compliance with key areas of patient safety
- In 2024, two major improvements to the clinical quality control framework were rolled out. First, in January 2024, we issued the new group wide integrated quality governance structure for Spire Hospitals. Second, in March 2024, we rolled out the new Patient Safety Incident Response Framework (PSIRF) (see page 26)
- The central clinical team oversees a national programme of clinical reviews including testing, according to the approach taken at regulatory inspections
- The central clinical team also oversees the drafting, communication and training of a comprehensive set of clinical policies and procedures for Spire Healthcare. These form part of the overall framework for clinical safety governance and quality, to ensure that clinical risk and clinical regulatory compliance is managed effectively across all registered sites. The governance activities are monitored by the integrated quality governance team and are reported regularly to the safety, quality and risk committee, the executive committee and the clinical governance and safety committee
- Each hospital has a risk register through which clinical and medical risks are managed, mitigated and escalated
- Comprehensive, non-financial management information on quality including safety, clinical effectiveness and patient experience is produced and reviewed monthly against pre-agreed standards by the corporate integrated quality governance and clinical teams and reported to the safety quality and risk committee sub-committee bi-monthly and reported to the clinical governance and safety committee quarterly
- We are subject to substantial levels of external inspection and review, both by the range of national healthcare regulators (CQC/HIW/HIS), and through invited assurance inspections such as the rolling programme of health and safety inspections carried out by third-party specialists. The executive committee and the clinical governance and safety committee review the outcomes of these activities. In 2024, we had a total of four CQC and HIW/HIS inspections, all producing 'Good', 'Outstanding', or equivalent performance assessments
- We have maintained throughout 2024 the structures and processes to provide the level of evidence and assurance required to monitor clinical regulatory compliance

## 3) Financial and operational controls

Our design of our finance function splits resources across on-site finance directors at each hospital, supported by a central finance function based in Reading.

We received regular fraud updates from the NHS Counter Fraud Authority during the year and, where relevant, disseminated the fraud alerts to relevant colleagues. We were subject to daily direct and indirect cyber-attacks during the year. We have prepared response plans to cyber-attacks utilising both in-house and third-party experts. After any incident, we undertake a full incident review and reflect learnings into our cyber-security environment.

The fundamental financial controls as reported in 2023 remained in place during 2024, namely:

- The annual process of preparing business plans and budgets, followed up by close monitoring of operational performance by the executive committee and the board
- Weekly forecasting and actual reviews to drive corrective actions
- Monthly monitoring of actual results, compared to budgets, forecasts and the previous year
- All material capital, leasing and acquisition projects are subject to an investment evaluation and authorisation procedure, including board approval, when the forecast expenditure exceeds the level of delegated authority
- Common accounting policies and procedures
- Our cash flow position is regularly reviewed to ensure that our borrowings are aligned with our growth. Half yearly detailed cash flow forecasts are reviewed and used for controls over going concern, goodwill impairment and banking covenant assessments
- Forced segregation of duty and senior review of all payments made
- Other non-financial operational risks are managed by means of the application of best practice, as defined by group policies and standard procedures, in areas such as project management, human resources management and IT security and delivery, supported by detailed performance monitoring of outputs and issues
- Consolidation of our accounts bi-annually for accurate reporting purposes
- Key account balance sheet reconciliations to ensure accuracy within our accounts

Other non-financial operational risks are managed by means of the application of best practice, as defined by group policies and standard procedures, in areas such as project management, human resources management and IT security and delivery, supported by detailed performance monitoring of outputs and issues.

The Financial Reporting Council published the 2024 Corporate Governance Code requiring new disclosures over our risk management and internal control environment for our fiscal year starting 1 January 2026. We continue to prepare for these new requirements by documenting and strengthening our internal financial controls where appropriate.

## 4) Internal Audit

An in-house director of internal audit was supported by a dedicated team from KPMG who provide co-source internal audit resource. From 2025, this service has moved to RSM. The activities of internal audit are reported in the audit and risk committee report on pages 105 to 110.

## Continuous learning

Our process of continuous improvement through events, knowledge and awareness will help us to make progress. We recognise this unequivocally and its importance in driving outstanding quality. No matter how robust and reliable, internal control systems and risk management cannot guarantee to remove all error or loss. We take all instances of incidents (including near misses), complaints, control failures, regulatory non-compliance, or other risk events seriously. As such, we have a detailed process in place to understand the cause and identify learning to minimise the chances of recurrence.

We actively promote an open culture to positively encourage the reporting of all risk events and other issues arising. Hospital management, the executive committee, the ARC, and the CGSC closely monitor the number and nature of events arising, and the operation of incident management processes.

We offer various channels through which colleagues can report any issues or concerns. The main channel for raising concerns is the Freedom to Speak Up guardians (FTSU) that were introduced into every Spire Healthcare hospital, corporate team and VHG. Other channels include a central raising concerns team, members of the executive team and board, and an independent whistleblowing helpline to facilitate anonymous reporting of issues or concerns that they are unwilling to raise via any other channel. We have an independent national corporate guardian who oversees and supports the guardians (see Strategy: Building on quality, page 27).

## 1. Inflation and wage inflation

Executive owner(s): Chief financial officer/Chief operating officer/Chief people director

## Risk description

## Risk mitigation

Consumer Price Inflation in the UK was 2.5% for the year to 31 December 2024. The Bank of England reduced the base lending rate to 4.5% in February 2025, but the Bank of England remains cautious about service sector and wage inflation. There is still risk of further energy price shocks and food price shocks from increased geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and the Middle East.

The Bank of England's baseline prediction for 2025 is 3.2% for average private sector wage growth, but report companies surveyed expected wage growth nearer 4% (November 2024 Monetary Policy Report). National insurance contributions increase to 15% from 1 April 2025 with significant increases to minimum and national living wages (range 6.7%-18%).

Despite these inflationary headwinds the expectation is that the primary growth drivers for healthcare will remain medium term, namely NHS waiting lists stimulating stable/growing PMI lives covered and a self-pay market which is larger than pre-pandemic.

## Risk impact

- Higher staff churn because of more competitive pay in other sectors/other healthcare providers or higher staff costs to maintain competitive pay and benefits
- Reduction of self-pay patients as inflationary pressures reduce affordability and reducing volumes
- On contract renewals, PMI providers take more aggressive stance on pricing to mitigate from recent inflationary increases, reducing margin
- NHS tariff increases are below the level of inflation thus reducing margin
- Tax bill higher further to national insurance increase

Risk appetite

Strategy key

<!-- image -->

In response to macro inflationary pressure, we continue to benefit from a range of inflation mechanisms built into the PMI contracts and will benefit from our ability to change self-pay pricing quickly via our pricing engine subject to prevailing market conditions. Our conversion rate from outpatient appointment to inpatient procedure remains stable. Our procurement team maintains a constant review of pricing and seeks opportunities to mitigate inflationary increases.

We continue to respond to changing economic circumstances by optimising our private and NHS-funded work, ensuring we are not over-reliant on one income source, and supported by an efficient cost base.

## 2. Private market dynamics

Executive owner(s): Chief commercial officer

## Risk description

There is a risk that private healthcare demand softens after the post-pandemic period of growth because of:

- The significant buying power of the top four insurance providers which have an estimated 90% market share. We have individual contractual relationships for the provision of our services with all the major PMI providers. These contracts come up for renewal on a recurring basis. It is possible that renewal of contract terms cannot be secured on historical terms

The self-pay market softens because of:

- A material lowering of NHS waiting lists for key self-pay procedures within the Spire footprint, reducing demand
- Affordability among our core target market decreases as inflation or higher tax take reduces disposable income
- Growth in the self-pay market is constrained by low growth in the UK economy
- New competitors price to secure market share

## Risk impact

- Loss of, or renewal at lower tariffs, of an existing PMI contractual relationship with any of the key insurers could significantly reduce our revenue and profit
- In 2024, self-pay patients contributed 22.6% of group turnover. A material reduction in the self-pay market could have a material impact on our profitability and margin

## Risk mitigation

We invest in high-quality patient care service to our self-pay and insured patients of our PMI partners.

We ensure we have long-term contracts in place with our PMI partners that avoids co-termination of contractual arrangements.

We believe that continuing to invest in our well-placed portfolio of hospitals provides a natural fit to the local requirements of all the PMI providers long term.

We continue to invest in efficiency programmes to ensure that we can offer the best combination of high-quality patient care at competitive prices.

Since 2022, we have deployed national multi-media advertising campaigns highlighting the key benefits of private healthcare to increase our brand awareness.

We are strengthening our operational capability with further enhancements to the website (content and functionality) and call centre resilience and training.

We have adopted sophisticated pricing capability.

We are promoting patient financing as a payment option.

## 3. Climate change

Executive owner(s): Chief financial officer

## Risk description

Climate-related risks have been identified through the enterprise risk management process. In 2023, we undertook scenario analysis to identify our short-, medium- and long-term risks from climate change.

Following the structure of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), we face risks and opportunities from the transition to a low carbon economy and physical risks from a warming climate. This principal risk is an overarching description of those individual risks that are described in greater detail in our TCFD annual reporting.

We may, in the medium to long term, be indirectly at risk from societal risks related to climate change, eg, food security.

## Risk impact

Severe stormy weather has the potential to cause major damage and disruption to our sites. Storm events raise the risk of floods at our buildings due to rising external water levels. Our hospitals would be badly affected by flooding should it occur, as water ingress would affect medical equipment and risk the hygiene of our premises and safety of our patients.

Extreme weather events will also disrupt our patients, staff, and consultants' ability to attend our facilities.

Prolonged spells of extreme ambient temperatures could lead to an inability of existing critical Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems to cope with required cooling and potentially cause cancellation of procedures and operations.

Providing healthcare services is a relatively energy intensive business. We are vulnerable to fluctuations in energy prices driven by rising carbon costs imposed on power generators as well as through increasing taxation at the point of consumption.

## Risk mitigation

Flood risk mitigation includes a continued periodic review of our estate in relation to existing and predicted flood risk zones and investment in improved roofing and drainage where vulnerabilities have been identified. None of our current sites are situated in predicted high risk flood zones or in coastal areas predicted to be at risk from rising sea levels.

Extreme ambient temperature risk mitigation includes an informed investment plan for upgrade of failing and vulnerable plant. Design of the replacement and upgrade would account for the predicted increase in ambient temperature profiles expected within the lifespan of the plant eg, 15 years. Further mitigation measures include extreme weather warning protocol and business continuity plans to provide emergency loan HVAC plant.

Energy price risk mitigation includes energy efficiency measures to reduce consumption and our energy hedging strategy which has seen all our current energy requirements secured until December 2025.

## 4. Cyber security

Executive owner(s): Chief operating officer/General counsel

## Risk description

## Risk mitigation

As a healthcare organisation, we must manage and maintain a range of physical and digital data assets including patient records, commercial information and staff data. Our intelligence indicates that healthcare data remains highly valuable to criminal and hostile state operators. There is a risk that:

- We will be subject to hostile and sophisticated cyber activity against our IT systems and applications
- Supply chain cyber-attacks become more prevalent as a means to gain unauthorised access to that organisation's systems or data
- We, and through our supply chain, do not respond effectively to a cyber-attack
- Someone inside the company exploits a system to cause damage or steal data.
- Phishing email attacks, the most common form of cyber-crime, breach our defences

## Risk impact

Our business could be disrupted if its information systems fail, are breached, destroyed or damaged. Colleague and patient data could be stolen or compromised. We could also be subject to litigation by third parties and enforcement action from regulators. A successful cyber-attack and a breach of data security could result in:

- Material costs to recover operations
- Operational risk with IT services not being available
- Material financial penalties for breaches of data protection law
- Compensation for patients or staff if personal data is compromised
- Reputational damage
- Stolen credentials (the most common cause of data breaches) as a result of a successful phishing email attack being used for data theft, financial losses, and reputational damage.

The data strategy, governance and security committee monitor the risk and mitigations for cyber security. The committee reports into the executive committee with a separate reporting line to the audit and risk committee. To support this governance structure, we have a range of policies and practices, and mandatory staff training covering cyber security (more detail on page 54).

Our IT team have a cyber-security strategy for continuous improvement based on industry standards. It covers the processes from identifying specific risks, to protecting physical and digital data assets through to recovery in the event of a successful cyber-attack.

We work with several industry-leading technical partners to provide:

- Multiple layers of security controls providing advanced detection and protection capabilities
- Regular third-party penetration testing on new and existing IT systems
- Red-teaming exercises to attempt to access our systems using a variety of real-world techniques
- Managed Security Operations Centre (SOC) to monitor, analyse and respond to security threats 24x7
- Threat intelligence from a variety of external sources
- Varonis DatAlert system is in place for user behaviour analytics that uses algorithms and machine learning to detect anomalies in the behaviour of both users and devices
- Third party (Reliance) triage of colleagues reporting potential phishing emails via the 'Phish Alert' button
- Enhanced detection of phishing emails via Microsoft Exchange Online Protection (EOP)

## 6. Digitalisation, automation and efficiency

Executive owner(s): Chief operating officer

## Risk description

We are making substantial investment to digitalise our patient experience as well as back-office processes. However, despite our digitalisation programme there is a risk that:

- The digital environment evolves requiring us to readjust or increase our investment to further retain or improve our position in the market
- We do not deploy new technologies with the support and training of our colleagues, thus undermining the potential for efficiency gains
- Loss of IT and other team members because of the competitive market for scarce talent which would hinder our progress and/or increase costs of implementation
- There is a risk that a standardised approach to testing and adoption to change practices is not consistent across the deployed changes

## Risk impact

We lose market share and fail to achieve operational excellence which will ultimately impact our profit margin.

The digital strategy focuses on an 18-24 month planning horizon to improve the predictability of investment and outcomes. This enables us to adjust the priorities (through transparent visibility and reporting), managing flexibility to investment and increase speed of implementation, consider informed changes in approach in response to changes in the macro climate and competitive landscape.

We utilise best-practice programme governance, supported by third-party experts, to deliver change programmes into the business, coupled with the adoption of lean, agile change methodology along with driving and adopting one-best way eg patient support centres. In addition, we have initiated quality assurance and assessment via a trusted independent partner.

In addition, we developed and introduced in 2024, a strategic response and approach to the specific management of change and implementation. This involved upskilling colleagues and increasing the programme management structure to provide the required standards of: impact assessment, colleague engagement, training, adoption strategies and ensuring accurate and effective embedding of new ways of working, in order to maximise business opportunities and performance improvements.

We use technology to enable early benefits' realisation, for example utilising process automation to release immediate efficiencies and improvements to boost productivity and further fund future investments for digitisation. Clinical Safety and Standards will be involved in the input to design.

The digital strategy has built-in focus on appropriate levels of innovation, coupled with external horizon scanning, to ensure we are not behind the curve compared to competitors (current or future).

## 7. NHS market dynamics

Executive owner(s): Chief commercial officer

## Risk description

Historically, the levels of NHS referrals have been subject to sudden and unpredictable changes dependent upon national political priorities, or local NHS financial constraints. There remains a risk of future volatility in NHS commissioning models.

## Risk impact

Changes to NHS commissioning models, if adverse, could lead to reduced access to patients, reduced tariffs adversely affecting revenues and/or margins.

Overview

Strategic report

Governance report

Link to strategy

## Risk mitigation

We apply a disciplined approach to what procedures we will undertake for the NHS to optimise the balance of resource utilisation and margin contribution.

We maintain diversification of revenue streams with self-pay, PMI patients and new business streams.

We continue to invest in the capital base of our hospitals to provide services needed by the NHS (eg diagnostics).

We continue to invest in efficiency programmes to ensure that we can offer the best combination of high-quality patient care with acceptable margins at NHS tariff prices.

We have a strategic partnership with the NHS and stand ready to take on more NHS work, and we are actively engaged in the 2025/26 NHS Payment Scheme consultation (see page 19 for more detail).

We have strong relationships with the Integrated Care Systems (ICSs) and signed contracts with all ICSs.

Vita Health Group's acquisition in 2023 gave us a new opportunity to participate in the NHS tender market.

## 8. Brand reputation

Executive owner(s): Chief commercial officer

## Risk description

Our brand reputation is interconnected with other principal risks, especially clinical quality and cyber security.

Our future growth depends upon our ability to maintain, and continue to enhance, our reputation amongst patients, clinicians and other stakeholders.

As our brand presence grows, the risk increases that adverse events such as:

- Patient notifications and recalls
- Inquests
- Mishandling of patient data
- A breach of law or regulation

## Risk impact

If we fail to protect or grow the brand it may harm our ability to:

- Maintain or grow income
- Attract and retain patients, colleagues and consultant partners
- Win new contracts
- Raise capital at competitive rates
- Meet our regulatory obligations

## 9. Government policy

Executive owner(s): Chief executive officer

## Risk description

There is a general risk that the government's economic, public spending and employment policies could have an impact on our sector.

The new government's objective to address workplace absence could provide a further opportunity for our occupational health, mental health and muscular skeletal businesses which help to get people back to work.

The impact of wage settlements in the public sector on our ability to attract and retain healthcare workers, is captured in our principal risk Inflation and Wage Inflation.

## Risk impact

Changes in government policy for the NHS or broader fiscal and spending policy, could materially affect our profitability.

## Risk mitigation

We have a proactive strategy to establish and build relationships with new government ministers and advisors in both the health department and other related departments (eg Department for Work and Pensions).

We seek to build relationships with our local MPs, and have written to newly elected MPs, who cover our physical locations across Great Britain to introduce them to Spire Healthcare and build their understanding of what we do.

We are actively engaging with the Independent Healthcare Providers Network (IHPN) to support IHPN's input into the Government's 10-year NHS strategic plan.

## 10. Supply chain disruption

Executive owner(s): Chief financial officer

## Risk description

Disruption in the global and UK supply chains because of a variety of factors, could lead to shortages of critical components or products within:

- -Medicines
- -Consumables
- -Prostheses
- -Food
- -Green energy supply
- -Medical gases
- -Oil and gas
- -Electronic components for medical equipment

## Risk impact

Our hospitals are reliant on a wide range of products to be able to conduct operations and procedures. Shortfalls in fulfilment of fresh food orders for example, could result in hospitals having to cancel inpatient operations and procedures.

We are heavily reliant on medical consumables, that in turn are heavily reliant on the availability of plastics, to carry out even the most basic procedures (eg, taking blood samples). Shortages in raw materials or disruption in the supply chain from the manufacturer could result in hospitals having to cancel operations and procedures.

<!-- image -->

## Risk mitigation

We run a centralised supply chain with a national distribution centre (NDC) and its own vehicle and driver fleet. Medical consumables are held at the NDC with an average of six weeks' supply; medicines and prostheses are being held at  hospital sites.

We must respond to product shortages and global recalls consistently, and we have seen some minor shortfalls in order fulfilment. In all cases, our centralised procurement function has been able, with the support of a permanent presence from the clinical team, to find alternative supplies to maintain hospitals' activities.

Fresh food is supplied through a national food distributor which has its own delivery fleet and directly employs its HGV drivers. Order fulfilment has remained in the high ninety percentile. We have contingency menu plans in case of fresh food shortages.

Any national shortages in critical medicines and medical gases are managed by NHS Supply Chain. We receive allocations based on our activity.

In light of recent geopolitical events, we are retesting our supply chain resilience against a range of scenarios, having last done that exercise in 2022-23.

## 11. Major infrastructure failure

Executive owner(s): Chief operating officer

## Risk description

There is a risk that there is a failure of national infrastructure, eg:

- The national electricity grid
- Import channels for our UK-based suppliers
- Fuel distribution
- Access to NHS
- Telecoms providers

The above risks are from a variety of causes including lack of resilience in national infrastructure, cyber-attack, strike action, terrorist activity, international geopolitical tensions, and action by state governments wishing to harm the UK.

As international geopolitical events since 2022 with the invasion of Ukraine have demonstrated, this risk can materialise unexpectedly and rapidly.

## Risk impact

Our hospitals are reliant on the provision of electricity from the national grid. Main power outages result in the immediate cancellation of procedures under general anaesthetic.

Failure of logistic channels is covered in supply chain failure risk.

In very rare cases, patients need to be transferred to the NHS for further treatment and service level agreements (SLAs) are in place with NHS bodies to facilitate this. If local NHS trust hospitals are overburdened, or suffering strike action, there could be delays in transferring patients.

Core IT services are increasingly reliant on 'cloud' infrastructure. These services rely on connectivity from UK-based telecoms providers.

## Risk mitigation

We maintain the following controls to mitigate against a failure of patient safety and clinical quality:

- All our hospitals have a backup power source provided from diesel powered generators that operates major circuits of a hospital, but some key equipment is not covered, eg, MRI scanners. Battery powered uninterrupted power is provided into specific equipment in theatres to ensure patients remain safe in the event of a generator failure. These backup power sources are designed to keep patients in the hospital safe but are not a complete substitute for mains power
- Our national distribution fleet refuel daily at the end of their shifts to ensure resilient operational capability
- NHS hospitals are obliged to provide emergency care to everyone but their pressures on ambulance services can, and do, lead to delays to emergency transfers on rare occasions. Mitigation plans are in place and rehearsed at hospitals
- The chief operating officer chairs a regular multi-disciplinary winter planning meeting to co-ordinate response activities to any infrastructure failures
- The use of the Microsoft Azure 'cloud' platform for core Spire IT services is split into multiple availability zones. Primary Service is hosted in UK South (London) and Secondary Service in UK West (Wales)
- Spire IT on-premise infrastructure is hosted in Telehouse Docklands with resilient power, communications, monitoring and cooling technologies

## 12. Clinical quality

Executive owner(s): Group medical director/Group clinical director

## Risk description

## Risk mitigation

There is a risk that we fail to maintain the high levels of clinical quality required to meet our patients' needs and expectations, strategic objectives, and regulatory and legal requirements. There are several reasons this could happen including:

- Increasing complexity of patient conditions and innovations in treatments
- Changing regulatory environment
- Pressure to treat at the margin of our capability from long waiting lists with patients with increased co-morbidities
- A failure to identify and embed learning from incidents and excellence.
- The challenge of our scale and dispersed sites poses to ensuring oversight and assurance
- Human factors in the delivery of processes by our teams

## Risk impact

Reputational and financial loss could occur if we fail to maintain high levels of clinical care from regulatory sanctions, patient claims, a fall in patient volumes and adverse publicity.

We maintain the following core processes to monitor clinical quality:

- Quality and safety reporting based on a quality assurance framework with a standard set of KPIs
- A schedule of robust and regular internal hospital inspections including the patient safety and quality reviews, with action plans for improvement that is centrally monitored
- A schedule of excellence in care meetings with the group clinical director and directors of clinical services to drive assurance and accountability for standards of care
- Consistent reporting of clinical outcome and effectiveness measures within the hospital and central meeting governance structures (including medical advisory committee meetings) to ensure that insights and learning are actioned and shared

These processes are underpinned by:

- A reporting culture of openness and shared learning from ward-to-board, with a FTSU guardian at each site
- Timely incident reporting via a database with central oversight and development of actions to ensure learning. We utilise the new Patient Safety Incidence Response Framework (PSIRF) introduced in 2024
- Continuous monitoring of patient experience via regular surveys with policies and procedures in place to ensure learning from patient experience feedback (including detractors and complaints)
- Standard operating procedure for patient notification exercises that includes learning and continuous improvement methodologies

Clinical quality processes and controls are governed by the executive's safety, quality and risk committee and the board's clinical governance and safety committee (CGSC).

## 13. Expanding our proposition

Executive owner(s): Chief commercial officer

## Risk description

There is a risk that:

- We will not be able to launch and scale new propositions or services at sufficient pace to diversify and mitigate the risk of disintermediation
- New digital healthcare services deliver lower margins and therefore contribution compared to existing services
- In making new acquisitions we may fail to derive the expected value from our acquisitions that will improve our return on capital employed as well as diversify our service offering

## Risk impact

We fail to grow the revenues, generate cash and provide a return on investment to investors of the group in line with our five-year strategic plan. We become disintermediated by new/specialist service providers.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Risk mitigation

We have:

- An innovation board bringing together the CEO and executive committee members of the medical, clinical, commercial and finance functions to identify healthcare trends and opportunities to develop new services
- A dedicated director of innovation and proposition development sourcing specific opportunities to support the group strategy, leading on development, supported with dedicated IT and project resource
- A dedicated director sourcing suitable target acquisitions supported by an expert external financial and tax adviser
- A property lead to handle the assessment and acquisition of new physical assets with the support of retained property advisers
- Acquisition due diligence processes using appropriate third-party expertise
- Board review and approval of acquisitions
- Post-acquisition project management and integration processes incorporating learnings from previous acquisitions

The acquisition of Vita Health Group has opened new commercial opportunities for us, but importantly also improved our mitigation of this risk.

## 14. Workforce

<!-- image -->

Executive owner(s): Group people director, Group clinical director, Chief operating officer

## Risk description

## Risk mitigation

There is both a UK and global shortage of nursing and healthcare practitioners. We compete for talent in the UK and from international demand, and increasingly for non-clinical roles in a candidate driven marketplace.

Our ability to attract and retain clinical and non-clinical colleagues has been affected by the following:

- The cost-of-living increase impacting all our colleagues. Those on the lower salary levels are more sensitive to inflationary pressures and may move to marginally higher payers, both within or outside of healthcare
- Increasingly, permanent colleagues are looking for more flexibility in their work environment and work-life balance
- The candidate-driven market which impacts salary expectations for key roles, and attraction of agency rates
- Growth of demand for healthcare services since the pandemic
- Revitalisation of the NHS and that it is exempt from the NI increase

## Risk impact

In the short term, the impact is on operating costs, either through increased pay awards or the use of bank and agency colleagues to fill resourcing gaps (for total colleague costs, see note 9 to the financial statements in this report).

Over the long-term, wage inflation and resource scarcity could result in a decline in our expected revenue growth. We could see hiring and retention of staff challenging in comparison to the NHS due to a higher tax bill.

We seek to retain colleagues through:

- A common purpose and a positive workplace culture (our employee engagement score provides evidence that this mitigation is effective)
- A standardised, fair and competitive pay and reward benefit structure. In 2023, we announced a competitive pay award that provided a 5.5% increase for most colleagues, and extra to bring all colleagues up to the living wage, and in September 2024 a further 2.75%. We will continue to review pay competitiveness in all the sectors in which we operate
- Our new reward framework for all permanent hospital (and NDC) colleagues was implemented in Q4 2024 (see page 30).
- Offering greater flexibility in colleagues' roles and contact types
- Ensuring we have the right and relevant employee development programmes, eg a nurse training programme and other relevant apprentice schemes
- Retaining professional development (excellence programme)
- Continuous investment in our equipment, facilities and services to retain high-quality clinicians and colleagues

Our risk mitigations have helped to produce a downward trend in colleague churn rates with consistent reduction during 2024 (see page 31).

We seek to recruit colleagues through:

- A centralised recruitment process which we brought in-house in 2023
- Offering apprenticeship programmes to support the development of clinical and non-clinical teams across the business
- Building of local bank colleague pools and using digital solutions to improve access to available shifts

The group manages immediate colleague shortages using agency and bank workers.

## 15. Data protection

Executive owner(s): Chief operating officer, General counsel

## Risk description

## Risk mitigation

As we continue to grow and acquire new businesses and services it is imperative we manage external as well as internal risks equally which could compromise physical and digital data assets.

The risk being personal data may not be managed in accordance with the principles set out in the Data Protection Act 2018 and the UK General Data Protection Regulations (UK GDPR) and the expectations of data subjects as a result of:

- Human error
- Insider threats
- Third party and supply chain involvement in the processing of personal data

## Risk impact

If this risk were to materialise, then there could be an impact on both data subjects and the business resulting in (among other impacts) impact to care, identity fraud and discrimination as well as reputational damage, enforcement action and financial loss respectively.

The data strategy, governance and security committee is chaired by the senior information risk owner and monitors the risks and mitigations for data privacy and cyber security. The committee reports into the executive committee with a separate reporting line to the audit and risk committee (see page 54 for more detail).

The following are the most material controls to mitigate the risk from materialising:

- -In-house data protection officer reports into the group general counsel, providing expertise and independence as a second line assurance mechanism
- -Dedicated governance platform for the management and oversight of data subject's rights requests
- -Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA) to assess data protection risks in the processing of data, and third-party vendor
- -Comprehensive data protection policies and procedures
- -Mandatory staff training covering data protection and cyber security
- -Privacy lead in each hospital and clinic that provide the link between local site and the central data protection team
- -Internal incident reporting system for reporting and managing data incidents used to identify trends and learnings
- -Quarterly data privacy key performance indicator reporting into the data strategy, governance and security working group

## 16. Anti-microbial resistance (AMR)

Executive owner(s): Group medical director

## Risk description

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health and development threat.

The World Health Organization has declared that AMR is one of the top 10 global public health threats facing humanity.

Misuse and overuse of antimicrobials are the main drivers in the development of drug-resistant pathogens.

The cost of AMR to the economy is significant. In addition to death and disability, prolonged illness results in longer hospital stays, the need for more expensive medicines and financial challenges for those impacted.

Without effective antimicrobials, the success of modern medicine in treating infections, including during major surgery and cancer chemotherapy, would be at increased risk.

Source: World Health Organization

## Risk impact

If AMR becomes prevalent in the UK, the ability for consultants to carry out routine elective surgery could become too dangerous. This would mean the current business model of Spire Healthcare will become unviable.

New antibiotic costs may increase substantially.

- -Participation in, and collaboration with, government's monitoring of AMR outbreaks
- -Requirement on clinicians to follow guidance in line with government guidelines on the prescribing of antibiotics
- -Access to up-to-date antimicrobial prescribing via online systems and access to microbiologists at all sites
- -Appropriate investigations of post-surgery infections including review of antibiotics

## Governance

## a) The board's oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities

Our board has ultimate oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities facing us. It exercises that oversight through:

- An annual review of our corporate strategy, that includes championing sustainability as one of its five pillars as described on pages 21 to 37
- Review of major strategic climate and environmental-related initiatives as put to the board by the executive committee in line with the corporate strategy eg, the environmental, social and governance strategy explained on pages 38 to 54 and the net zero strategy as explained on pages 39 to 41
- Receiving reports from board sub-committees following their meetings, eg, the audit and risk committee (ARC) that reviews the principal risks on behalf of the board and oversees our risk management processes, that includes climate-related risks, as explained on pages 65 to 76
- Annual review of emerging risks with the executive management team through the ARC

As the board also retains the authority to approve all capital projects over £10 million under its delegated levels of authority, in doing so, it reviews all major capital expenditure projects that affect sustainability.

## b) Management's role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities

The executive committee retains overall responsibility for assessing climate-related risks and opportunities.

The committee receives a quarterly report from the director of audit, risk and compliance on the principal risks and the overall risk profile of the group prior to reporting to the ARC. It is through that assessment, in conjunction with other management information, that the executive committee understands and acts on its assessment of climate-related risks. The committee also reviews global trends for emerging risks on an annual basis and submits a report to the ARC.

In 2023, we undertook a detailed scenario analysis exercise on our hospitals business based on future global warming scenarios. We will repeat this scenario analysis in 2026. The outcomes provided us with a detailed view of our potential physical and transitional risks from climate change. The outcomes are described in more detail on page 79 to 80.

The executive committee communicates with the board through two main reports from the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, and additional reports from the chief operating officer. The executive committee also presents reports to the board through specific topics that are on the agenda for the board.

In 2023, we established a sustainability committee chaired by the chief financial officer. The sustainability committee's remit is to oversee, review and recommend changes to Spire Healthcare's sustainability-related goals, objectives, commitments and key performance indicators and monitor the Group's progress against the same, including in relation to climate risks and opportunities.

The committee is composed of members of the executive committee and senior management and met four times in 2024.

## Strategy

## a)   Climate-related risks and opportunities the organisation has identified over the short, medium and long term

## Time frames

The board recognises that climate-related risks and opportunities would emerge over very long time frames, and well outside the normal five-year strategic planning horizon. Its review of going concern and viability are conducted over 12 months, and three years respectively, from the date of the balance sheet. The board conducts these reviews before publication of the interim and annual financial statements, and while they model the impact of a near-term climate event in line with the principal risks, do not capture longer-term impacts from climate change.

In 2023, we engaged WTW (formerly Willis Towers Watson) to consider:

- a)   transitional risks we may face in the scenario that by 2050, humanity has transitioned to a low carbon economy such that the increase in global average temperatures is restricted to 1.5˚C above pre-industrial times and

b)   the physical impacts of climate change up to 2100 because the effects of climate change will be more material over the longer time horizon.

WTW modelled the impacts to physical risks from climate change over the following time horizons:

- Short term - to 2030
- Medium term 2030-2050
- Long term 2050-2100

To quantify the impacts of the risks modelled in the physical and transitional risk scenarios, WTW used our risk impact assessment criteria contained within our enterprise risk management policy to maintain consistency with other risk categories as described in our principal risk section on pages 65 to 76. The outcomes of the scenario analysis are described below. The scenario analysis covered all physical assets of our operations in our ownership as at 1 January 2023, and therefore did not include the physical or transition risks of Vita Health Group that we acquired in October 2023. We will rerun the scenario analysis in 2026 on our asset base at the time.

## Relative importance of physical risks and transitional risks to the business

## Physical risks

From a climate change perspective, we consider our operations as one business unit because all of our operations are within the UK, and similar in nature. The scenario analysis to assess the physical risks covered the following chronic and acute climate risks:

| Chronic climate risks assessed                                                                        | Acute climate risks assessed                                                                         |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| - Heat-stress - Chronic drought-stress - Sea level rise - Chronic precipitation-stress - Fire weather | - Windstorm - Tornado - River flood - Flash flood - Coastal flood - Hailstorm - Lightning - Wildfire |

We provide commentary on the four most material physical risks associated with climate change below. The modelled outcomes of all the other risks above, but not described below, were immaterial. WTW's methodology input:

- the specific geographical locations of all our sites
- data concerning the building (eg number of storeys, building materials)
- insurance valuation
- revenue derived from each specific physical location, where that information was available
- historical business interruptions

The physical risk assessment relied on the use of WTW's climate diagnostic model, which uses underlying climate data provided by Munich Re's climate change hazard layers. The layers utilise data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), UKCP18, JBA Global Flood Model and the Met Office in the UK. The flood model provides a view of the risk based on an underlying digital terrain model, which provides a robust view of buildings and physical assets being exposed.

We modelled climate scenarios and corresponding average global warming based on the Inter-Governmental Panel for Climate Change's Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios:

- RCP2.6 (1.5°C)
- RCP4.5 (2-3°C)
- RCP8.5 (4°C+)

We report the outcomes of the scenario analysis using by the forecast impact for:

- Low emissions (RCP2.6 + 1.5°C) over the short term (to 2030) because there are no material differences in that time frame between the scenarios, and
- High emissions (RCP8.5 +4°C) over the medium term (to 2050) to illustrate the worst-case outcomes

We acknowledge that these risk modelled will have an increasing impact over the long term (2050-2100) in the high emissions scenario (RCP8.5), but have not reported them here given the increased uncertainty as to what will be the most likely scenario and risk impacts for these very long-term time frames.

| Heat stress Impact: negligible          | Currently all of our facilities are exposed to very low heat stress risk seeing less than five heatwave days each year with temperature morethan30°C. Someofourhospitals are vulnerable to overheating and air conditioning (AC) failure , especially in the south. As wehavearollingprogrammetoupgrade end-of-life ACsystems within our capital expenditure plans, there is nomaterial impact onourbusiness model.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Drought Impact: negligible              | Our facilities depend onastable supply of water from the mains water network to maintain safe patient care. Overall, there is very low or low exposure across our facilities, with less than three monthsofdrought duration per year, even in the south.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Flooding (all types) Impact: negligible | Flooding of our facility would necessitate partial or complete closure of the site until any cleanup and repairs are completed to enable safe patient care to resume. Most of our assets (96%) between 2023 and 2030, are at very low risk for river flooding. Our property portfolio has low exposure to heavy rainfall and potential flash floods in this time period. The average annual modelled losses from river flood are negligible. In severe years it could be more significant but even then, still negligible. Most of the financial impact is associated with property damagerather than loss of revenue. |
| Windstorm Impact: negligible            | All our facilities in the UKarein stormy regions, with 1%annualchance of having severe wind gusts of over 121km/hbetween2023and2030,withsevenlocations at risk of higher winds of 161-200km/h due to extratropical cyclone. Property damagefromwindstormcouldresult in partial or full closure of a site until repairs are completed to allow for safe operation of the site. Most of the financial impact is associated with property damage rather than loss of revenue.                                                                                                                                             |

The number of material incidents could increase up to five times compared with the 2022 heatwave including ACfailure, overheating including operating theatres, drug storage issues, patient andcolleague illness and morepotential closures. This could impact our long-term business model(beyond 2030) with a need to invest in additional methodsfor cooling patient and colleague areas within our facilities, especially in the south, not currently covered by existing ACsystems. |
| Drought Impact: minor to moderate       | There will likely be an increase in our exposure under this scenario by 2050. Forty-six facilities could becomeexposedtomoderatestress (three to four monthsofdrought per year), whilst 34facilities could be exposed to low risk and 14 facilities exposed to very low risk of drought stress. The potential adverse consequences to our business include reduced water availability and other utilities and operations relying onwater. This mayrequire additional investment between2030-2050 in back-up water supplies for some specific sites in the south if the national water network does not becomemoreresilient to drought.                                                                                                                                   |
| Flooding (all types) Impact: negligible | The numberofexposedlocations will not change substantially by 2050 but changes in the frequency of flood events is likely. Three facilities could be very highly exposed and one facility moderately exposed. By 2050 whatis considered today to be a severe 200-year event could happen morefrequently (ie one in 100 years). In a severe one in 100 future event, losses could be five times that of our current risk, but the risk still remains within the negligible impact range. To maintain current operations, additional flood protections mayberequired for those specific locations most at risk between 2030-2050 under this emissions scenario.                                                                                                            |
| Windstorm Impact: negligible            | The frequency and/or severity of windstorms (extratropical cyclones) are likely to be similar to current climate conditions for our locations of assets under this scenario and time frame. Therefore, the average annual modelled damagesfor both property damageandbusiness interruption stay in the sameimpactrange. The modelled outcomefromwindstormsuggests there isnoimpacton our current business model.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

## Transitional risks

In the transition to a low carbon economy by 2050, the assessment of transition risks assumes nation states adopt highly ambitious goals to dramatically reduce the impact of climate change. In line with our enterprise risk management methodology, we identified and quantified 12 transition risks in the categories recommended by the TCFD (being policies and legal risks, technology risks, market risks and opportunities, and reputational risks and opportunities). Only one risk concerning price fluctuations for the purchase of green energy is an immediate risk. We have taken the decision to purchase non-designated renewable energy 'brown' energy and delay the reduction in our carbon emissions until the 'green' energy market stabilises. We believe the other transitional risks and opportunities identified are currently immaterial but we will continue to monitor those remaining transitional risks.

## Impact on climate-related risk and opportunities on the financial statements

We have not identified any climate-related risks or opportunities that would have a material impact on the carrying values of the assets or liabilities of the group, and therefore we have not adjusted financial balances for climate-related risks or opportunities in our balance sheet as of 31 December 2024.

## Opportunities

We have an opportunity to turn some of the risks to opportunities, especially by communicating our environmental credentials more prominently, including our carbon reduction strategy, as a differentiator in the independent healthcare sector.

There are predictions that climate change disruptions will result in increased respiratory and cardiovascular disease, injuries and illness related to extreme weather events, changes in the prevalence and geographical distribution of food and water-borne illnesses and other infectious diseases, and threats to mental health. To support the UK to prepare for the health impacts of climate change, we continue to adapt and deliver quality healthcare services that meet changing needs in the market.

## b) Impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on our businesses, strategy and financial planning Financial impact of climate change risks and opportunities

We have focused on the near-term financial impacts for the purposes of the going concern and viability modelling. The outcomes of that modelling are reported in the statement on viability on page 83. We have previously announced that the net zero strategy represents a cash investment of £16 million up to 2030. In 2023, we invested £10.2 million of additional capital spend for 2024 to fund installations of PV solar panels (with an install capacity of 4.8m kWh/year) and building management systems across our estate. The projects are materially complete.

Following the outcome of our scenario analysis as discussed above, in our five-year strategic plan, other than the allocation of capital to the net zero strategy, and except for energy costs or potential losses from major disruption from an adverse weather event as modelled in our viability testing, we do not consider that other climate-related risks and opportunities will have a material impact on our revenues, operating costs, acquisitions, divestments and access to capital over that time horizon. In relation to energy costs, we have energy price hedging in place until December 2025 and partially for 2026. Thereafter, we are exposed to future energy prices. In terms of purchasing Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin, we monitor market conditions and if the cost premium reduces we will consider adoption, and in any event we will adopt by Jan 2030.

We have highlighted in the risk analysis above where over the medium term (2030-2050) and in the high emissions scenario, our business model may need to respond to changing climatic conditions.

Task force on climate-related financial disclosures (TCFD) report continued

## Other impacts on our business, strategy and financial planning

Our net zero strategy does not rely on unproven technology. Details of the net zero strategy are in the sustainability section on pages 39 to 41.

There has been no significant change in 2024 to our approach of identifying climate-related risks and opportunities, or our mitigation strategies against the risks we have identified. The process of risk management is described on pages 65 to 68. We will continue to review our mitigations through:

- Our normal risk management process
- Taking advantage of opportunities as we identify them, and they arise

## c) Resilience of our hospitals business strategy, including a 2°C or lower scenario

As described above, against the specific modelled risks, the outcomes indicate that our physical asset base, being largely low-rise buildings and away from flood plains around England, Scotland and Wales, is relatively well protected from projected adverse climate scenarios. We consider heat stress to be the most significant near-term risk with drought becoming an increased risk in the RCP8.5 (4°C+) scenario.

We assessed our exposure to transitional risks which, except for energy prices, we assess as negligible now. However, changes in the regulatory or legal environment, may materially change that assessment at short notice. Our business strategy to mitigate energy price fluctuations is to a) continue to invest in energy reduction measures, b) buy forward and fix prices for at least the full financial year ahead of the current financial year. Our overall business strategy, we believe, is resilient to the identified transitional risks because of their limited impact as we assess them now.

We therefore believe that our hospitals business model, of providing high-quality physical assets for third party consultants to use for the treatment of patients in the UK, remains resilient to our identified climate change risks.

## Risk management

## a) Our processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks

On pages 65 to 68 we describe our risk management process and its governance. We use the same process to identify and assess climate-related risks augmented by specific deeper dive risk assessments where appropriate. The relative importance of climate-related risks is established through the same method of estimating the range of potential impacts and the likelihood. As risk management is looking to the future, there is always a degree of uncertainty over probability and impact measures, especially with climate change, given the climate is dynamic and the changes are complex to model. Page 66 shows the relative importance we judge climate change risk to have compared to other principal risks. We have set out on page 79 and 80 what we believe are the climate-related risks that are specific to our circumstances.

## b) Our processes for managing climate-related risks

On pages 32-34 and 39-44, we describe the governance of climate-related risks and opportunities including the role the sustainability committee will have going forward. Our governance structure results in four levels of management of our climate-related risks and opportunities depending on the materiality of the activity as shown in the figure below.

## Board

Strategic direction, including approval of large-scale investment programmes reserved as a matter for the board

Executive committee (with specific delegated responsibilities to the sustainability committee) Determination of strategic direction and large-scale investment, approval of tactical investments

## Functional leadership

Group-wide tactical management

## Site level leadership

Local strategies and tactical implementation

The structure shown above reflects the type of actions we have taken to manage our climate-related risks, for example:

- Major strategic initiatives sponsored by the board, eg, the net zero strategy
- The pragmatic management of risk assessed and prioritised activities such as the replacement of ageing heating, ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC) systems, the installation of energy saving technologies from new building management software, solar panels and energy efficient lighting led by functional leadership reporting into the executive committee
- Local carbon champions working with their local leadership teams have developed site specific action plans that have been fundamental in making site level changes that are saving energy, reducing CO 2 emissions and improving waste disposal on a daily basis

## c)   How processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are integrated into our overall risk management

As the responsibility for identifying and managing risks, including climate-related risks, as set out on pages 65 to 68 is with the board, the executive committee (via the sustainability committee) and then through functional and local leadership, management of climate-related risks is entirely integrated into our normal management processes. We have not built a separate management process to manage climate change related risks and opportunities.

While various committees look at specific aspects of climate-related risks as described on page 81, reporting on the sustainability pillar of the corporate strategy is embedded in KPI reporting with all other strategic KPIs. From there, the identification, assessment and management of more detailed climate-related risk management activity is embedded within our established management systems, whether that be the recording of specific risk assessments within our risk management system, or the review and decision-making by established committees and local management teams.

## Metrics and targets

## a) Our metrics used to assess climate-related risks and opportunities

In our risk management process, we assess all risks against a range of impacts including financial, reputational and patient safety, amongst others.

In relation to climate change, the main strategic risk and opportunity for which we have developed is the decarbonisation of our operations in line with our net zero strategy. We use the following metrics to track progress towards achieving our net zero targets:

- Gas and electricity consumption against targets plus associated scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions twice yearly
- Carbon intensity against revenue annually
- Electricity generated by solar PV annually
- Waste to landfill/energy-from-waste/recycling
- Water consumption
- Financial losses due to climate-related incidents

We do not anticipate carbon credit pricing to impact our net zero strategy until 2030 when we plan to offset the residual unmitigated emissions.

We have separate metrics to measure our performance of waste management. Our metrics are described on page 42.

Against the risks that have been identified through our physical and transitional scenario analysis, we have developed further metrics in 2024 to monitor the likelihood and impact of the most material emerging risks (ie heat stress, drought, flooding and windstorm damage) and energy pricing.

We do not consider the use of internal carbon pricing is of any practical use as all our operations are in the UK, of a uniform nature and individual sites are charged for their actual energy consumption as the energy usage is metered.

## b) Our Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and their related risks

We disclose our GHG emissions, methodology and footprint boundary on page 39 to 41 in accordance with the methodology set out in the UK government's Environmental Reporting Guidelines 2019. For 2024, we set out our full GHG emissions data with 2023 comparisons.

There has been no change to the methodology applied to calculate our Scope 1 and 2 emissions in 2024. As we use an independent third party to calculate our emissions and none of our emissions data is based on estimated activity data, we believe the risk of material error in our data is low. We assess Scope 3 emissions to be material to our operations. On page 39, we set out our estimated Scope 3 emissions for 2023 and 2024, and describe the methodology by which each category has been calculated on page 40. As categories 1 and 2 (being the most material of our scope 3 emissions) are calculated on spend data, they are 100% estimated and therefore carry more risk of error. Last year we disclosed our 2022 estimated Scope 3 GHG emissions, the first we had calculated using a desktop methodology, with a total of 462,710tCO 2 e. That indicated to us that our Scope 3 emissions will be material. As explained on page 39, this has led us to undertake a more comprehensive calculation of our Scope 3 emissions and include them in our total GHG emissions data going forward.

We express our energy intensity ratio as a tCO 2 e per £m revenue. This ratio provides a consistent year-on-year basis to measure the energy required to deliver our operational activities. We now will track our change in intensity ratio against our full GHG footprint as disclosed on page 40 for 2023 and 2024.

## c) Our targets to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and performance against targets

The net zero target is measured as net zero CO 2 e (carbon dioxide equivalent) emissions, ie that CO 2 e emissions, taking 2019 as our baseline, will be fully mitigated or offset. Our performance for 2024 is reported on pages 39 to 40.

As we set out on page 39, considering our 2024 performance, the cost of REGOs and degasification of heating systems, and the evolving emissions reporting sphere, we have created a new interim target for 2025 to allow us time to assess the risks and mitigations to the profile of how we achieve net zero by 2030. If we change the profile of our net zero plan to 2030, we will also need to review our transitional risks as a different profile may impact transition risks.

The Remuneration Committee has debated the inclusion of 'Environmental' related metrics in incentive plans and whilst this is not included explicitly, these are inherent in our strategy and also help drive the quality metrics which are part of the incentive plans.

## Compliance statements

## Viability

## Assessment of prospects

In accordance with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, the directors assessed the viability of the group and have maintained a period of three years for their assessment. Although longer periods are used when making significant strategic decisions, three years has been used as it is considered the longest period of time over which suitable certainty for key assumptions in the current climate can be made. The assessment conducted considered the group's current financial position and forecasted revenue, EBITDA, cash flows, risk management controls and loan covenants over the three-year period (which is consistent with the approach for prior years, with the exception of capital structure due to refinancing).

## Assessment of viability

Further detail on both macroeconomic-related risk is provided in the risk management and internal control section on pages 65 to 76.

Other specific scenarios covered by our testing were as follows:

- The group is subject to temporary suspension of trade, with a temporary adverse impact on revenue, for example, as a result of a successful cyber-attack on key business systems
- The downside modelling of a number of risks which result in a decline in earnings, including the loss of a contractual relationship with a key insurer
- Significant change in government policy resulting in consultants going on payroll
- Short-term disruption to trade at a sub-set of hospitals owing to an extreme weather event

Management's approach also included testing for a specific combination of these risks. This testing entailed modelling for the potential impact if, although considered highly remote, the three risks which are individually plausible were to take place in combination.

This review included the following key assumptions:

- The group's senior finance facility and revolving credit facility which mature in February 2027 are refinanced to cover the three-year period. We have commenced the process to refinance our facilities and are confident that the facilities will be re-financed and will be in place for the three-year period. In the unlikely event that financing is not obtained, the Group has an extensive freehold property portfolio which could be accessed through sale and leaseback to provide the funding required, and
- The government will not make significant change to its existing policy towards utilising private provision of healthcare services to supplement the NHS

Based on the results of this analysis, the directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the next three years.

## Going concern

The group has undertaken extensive activity to identify plausible risks which may arise and mitigating actions. Further information on these is provided in the section on viability above. Based on the current assessment of the likelihood of these risks arising by 30 June 2026, together with their assessment of the planned mitigating actions being successful, the directors have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the accounts on a going concern basis. See note 2 - Basis of Preparation in the Financial Statements for more detail.

## Non-financial and sustainability information statement

The Companies Act 2006 requires the company to disclose certain non-financial and sustainability reporting information within the annual report and accounts. Accordingly, the disclosures required in the company's non-financial information and sustainability statement can be found on the following pages in the strategic report (or are incorporated into the strategic report by reference for these purposes from the pages noted):

- Information on our employees (page 29-31)
- Information on diversity (pages 30 and 46-48)
- Information on our anti-bribery and corruption policy (page 34)
- Information on our approach to raising concerns (whistleblowing) and Freedom to Speak Up (pages 16, 27, 29, 52, 53, 68, 74, 96, 103, 116)
- Information on our approach to human rights (page 53)
- Information on social matters (pages 45 to 50)
- Information on our environment policy (pages 39 to 44)
- Information on our climate-related financial disclosures in line with The Companies (Strategic Report) (Climate-related Financial Disclosure) Regulations 2022 (pages 77 to 82)

## Section 172 (1) statement

The directors are required to act in a way they consider, in good faith, would most likely promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole, taking into account the factors as listed in section 172 of the Companies Act 2006.

Details of how the directors have had regard to their section 172 duty can be found throughout the strategic and governance reports. We set out on pages 55 to 61, details of who we consider to be our main stakeholders, how we have engaged with them during the year and the outcomes of the process. Further details on how the directors' duties are discharged and the oversight of these duties are included in the governance section on pages 90 to 100. The principal decisions of the board during the year are shown on page 91.

## Dear shareholder,

I am pleased to report that Spire Healthcare delivered good financial and operational performance during 2024 and achieved guidance on all core measures. Group revenue was up 11.2% to £1,511.2 million from £1,359.0 million (up 6.2% on a comparable basis), driven by the demand for private healthcare and our expansion into primary care services.

Hospitals delivered increased revenue of 4.7% year on year to £1,390.2 million (5.5% on a comparable basis). This includes 1.9% growth in admissions and outpatient procedures, and strong growth in admissions average revenue per case which was up 4.2% through our focus on higher acuity procedures.

NHS activity was ahead of our expectations, with revenue up 7.7%, due to a focus on higher margin orthopaedic services (up 8.8% on a comparable basis). Private grew 3.7% (4.3% on a comparable basis), with strong volume and pricing in PMI and moderating volumes in self-pay, where we continue to see patients switching to PMI. Primary care services revenue was £121.0 million in 2024. Vita Health Group performed ahead of expectations, delivering £107.4 million in revenue.

We responded well to the dynamic external environment, including an evolving payor mix and increased energy costs, through acceleration of our cost savings programme, optimising acuity mix and self-pay pricing changes.

As a people business, investment in our workforce is critical to the health of Spire Healthcare and delivering good patient outcomes. People costs, including clinical and non-clinical staff, represent more than 40% of our Group cost base. We supported eligible Hospital colleagues with an above inflation salary increase during the year, implemented a new Hospital Rewards Framework and once again broadened our apprenticeship programme. We believe these efforts have helped us to achieve record levels of permanent employment, high retention, and a reduction in clinical turnover rates to an all-time low of 11.5%.

A significant focus area is our cost savings programme, which delivered ahead of plan, saving over £20.0 million. Key cost-saving initiatives included the refinement of best practice staffing establishment models for hospitals, centralisation of certain administration functions and procurement savings.

We intend to target £80 million in cumulative cost savings by the end of 2026, of which at least £30 million new savings will be targeted in 2025.

Group adjusted EBITDA was £260.0 million, up 11.1% year on year (9.0% on a comparable basis). Hospitals adjusted EBITDA was £249.7 million and showed good EBITDA margin progress, up 40 bps to 18.0%, delivered through price and acuity benefits, and transformation efficiencies.

Primary care services generated EBITDA of £10.3 million, with a very strong expansion in EBITDA margin to 8.5%. EBITDA margins are intrinsically lower than the hospital business given they include a number of younger maturity services such as Spire Clinics and London Doctors Clinic. Over time, we expect these margins to increase significantly through a combination of building scale and maturity.

We have delivered an improvement in returns, with ROCE growing from 7.5% to 8.2%. Total capital expenditure was £112.1 million; we deployed a greater proportion of our budget towards driving growth and efficiency. Investment of £40.0 million was deployed towards growth, including the addition of a minor operations unit at Spire Claremont, five new MRIs, significant investment in solar energy, as well as digitalisation. The remainder was dedicated to maintenance of our estate and IT infrastructure enhancement. We also deployed growth investment towards a primary care expansion strategy, including opening Spire Clinics in Abergele, Harrogate and Norwich.

Net bank debt at the end of the year was £325.9 million, with a cash balance of £41.2 million. Net bank debt / adjusted EBITDA covenant ratio declined to 2.0x.

Looking ahead to 2025, we are confident in delivering revenue growth, driven by both our hospitals and the increasing demand for primary care. We expect earnings to be ahead of last year, despite the impact of national insurance, national minimum wage and energy costs.

## Revenue

Group revenue was up 11.2% to £1,511.2 million from 1,359.0 million, up 6.2% on a comparable basis, driven by the demand for private healthcare and our expansion into primary care services.

Hospitals delivered increased revenue of 4.7% year on year to £1,390.2 million, 5.5% on a comparable basis. This includes 1.3% growth in admissions and outpatient procedures, 1.9% on a comparable basis, and strong growth in admissions average revenue per case which was up 4.4% as a result of our focus on higher acuity procedures, 4.2% on a comparable basis.

NHS activity was ahead of our expectations, with revenue up 7.7%, due to a focus on higher margin orthopaedic services, up 8.8% on a comparable basis. Private grew 3.7%, 4.3% on a comparable basis, with strong volume and pricing in PMI and moderating volumes in self-pay where we continue to see patients switching to PMI. Primary care includes Vita Health Group (VHG), which was acquired at the end of 2023 and represents the majority of the business line. VHG is the largest independent NHS talking therapies provider and delivers musculoskeletal (physio) and dermatology services. Primary care services revenue was £121.0 million in 2024. Vita Health Group performed ahead of expectations, delivering £107.4 million in revenue.

Primary care also includes our private GP services delivered through the London Doctors Clinic (LDC), Spire Occupational Health services and our recently opened Spire Clinics which are focused on outpatient treatment, diagnostics and act as referral centres to our hospitals. As our broader healthcare offering continues to be developed, income from this area will become increasingly material to the group's performance.

## Cost of sales and gross profit

For the Hospitals business, gross margin remained flat at 46.2%. Cost of sales increased in the period by £34.1 million or to £748.4 million (2023: £714.3 million). Increased costs are due to inflationary pressures and continued wage rate expansion, managed effectively through strong procurement processes, the benefit of an energy hedge for the majority of the year (which rolled off in early Q4) and our transformation cost savings programme; alongside optimisation of acuity, payor mix and pricing.

Primary Care gross margin decreased slightly to 34.5% from 34.7% as they include a number of younger maturity services across the Spire Clinics and LDC. Over time, we expect these margins to increase significantly through a combination of building scale and maturity.

Cost of sales is broken down, and presented as a percentage of relevant revenue, as follows:

## Other operating costs

For the Hospitals business other operating costs, excluding adjusting items have increased by £25.4 million, or 5.2% to £511.1 million (2023: £485.7 million). The main driver is increased central and non-clinical staff costs due to continued wage rate expansion and other inflationary pressures. Depreciation for the year was £106.4 million (2023: £102.6 million). The increase in depreciation is in line with expectations and is due to increased capex investment and RPI increases on properties. Operating margin for the year ended 31 December 2024 is 9.7% (2023: 9.6%). Operating margin, excluding adjusting items is 10.3%, up from 9.9% at 2023.

Other operating costs for the primary care business is £39.5 million (2023: £11.7million). Depreciation and amortisation for the year was £4.2 million (2023: £1.0 million).

## Adjusted EBITDA

Group adjusted EBITDA increased by 11.1% to £260.0 million from £234.0 million, 9% on a comparable basis.

Hospitals adjusted EBITDA was £249.7 million (2023: £233.8 million) delivered through price and acuity benefits, and transformation cost savings; whilst also seeing investment in hospital staff, payor mix changes and energy cost rises as discussed above.

Primary care services adjusted EBITDA was £10.3 million (2023: £0.2 million), with a very strong expansion in EBITDA margin of 340 bps, on a comparable basis, to 8.5%. Primary care services have lower EBITDA margins than the group given they include a number of younger maturity services across the Spire Clinics and LDC. Over time, we expect these margins to increase significantly through a combination of building scale and maturity.

## Share-based payments

During the period, grants were made to executive directors and other employees under the company's Long Term Incentive Plan. For the year ended 31 December 2024, the charge to the income statement is £4.2 million (2023: £3.7 million), or £4.7 million inclusive of National Insurance (2023: £4.1 million). Further details are contained in note 29.

Adjusting items comprise those matters where the directors believe the financial effect should be adjusted for, due to their nature, size or incidence, in order to provide a more accurate comparison of the group's underlying performance.

Asset acquisitions, disposals and aborted project credit of £2.8 million includes a profit of £4.5 million relating to the sale of the group's Tunbridge Wells hospital to Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust ('Trust') for £9.975 million. Refer to disposal note 35 for more details. In addition, there is £0.6 million of integration and other acquisition costs relating to the VHG acquisition and £0.6 million true up to provision on the DCG and Claremont acquisitions.

In the prior year, costs of £3.1 million mainly relate to asset acquisitions of Vita Health Group Limited and The Doctors Clinic Group.

Business reorganisation and corporate restructuring relates to the group announcement of a strategic, group wide initiative in H2 21 that will enable a more efficient business operating model, including leveraging digital solutions and technology. As a result of this initiative, additional costs of £3.5 million (2023: £2.0 million) have been incurred in the period, bringing costs to date of £9.3 million. This initiative is being implemented over several phases and is likely to be materially completed during 2026 as communicated at our capital markets event in April 2024. Future costs are not disclosed as a reliable estimate cannot be made due to the nature of the matter. £0.7 million has been incurred in respect of restructuring costs relating to the Doctors Clinic Group.

Remediation of regulatory compliance or malpractice costs reflect an increase in the provision in June 2024 of £4.6 million (2023: £2.5 million). The provision was established by Spire Healthcare in respect of implementing the recommendations of the Independent Inquiry including a detailed patient review and support for patients of Paterson. The project is complex and the process for review and settlement of claims, where relevant, takes some time. The detailed patient review has now reached the milestone of having contacted all living patients and invited them, where appropriate, to consultations to discuss their care. As a consequence, the rate of new claims has dropped significantly, as most patients now have their outcomes of their review and have initiated their claim, where relevant. Claims activity in the second half of the year has therefore been in line with the assumptions taken by management and the provision established at the half year. As a result there has been no subsequent increase in the provision. In addition, £1.7 million of legal fees have been incurred for the ongoing inquests. Whilst it is possible that, as further information becomes available, an adjustment to this provision will be required, at this time it reflects management's best estimate of the costs and settlement of claims.

In the prior year the group has recognised a credit of £0.9 million in respect of Remediation of Regulatory Compliance or Malpractice Costs relating to Paterson. This comprised £2.5 million funds received from its insurer and £0.9 million reduction in provision which had been held to resolve the matter. This was offset by an increased separate provision in respect of Paterson by £2.5 million.

Clinic set up costs relate to costs incurred for the set-up of the Abergele and Harrogate clinics prior to opening. The clinic in Abergele opened in February 2024 and Harrogate in January 2025.

£0.9 million of amortisation on acquired intangible assets related to the customer contracts recognised on the acquisition of VHG in October 2023.

## Net finance costs

Net finance costs have increased by £7.6 million to £99.2 million (2023: £91.6 million). Mainly due to RPI increases on leases and a slightly higher average interest rate on bank borrowings.

## Taxation

The effective tax rate assessed for the year, all of which arises in the UK, differs from the standard weighted rate of corporation tax in the UK. The reconciliation of the actual tax charge to that at the domestic corporation tax rate is as follows:

Corporation tax is calculated at 25.0% (2023: 23.5%) of the estimated taxable profit or loss for the year. The effective tax rate on profit before taxation for the year is 32.1%. The effective tax rate is higher than the UK rate due to due to the impact of prior year adjustments and non-deductible items. Excluding the adjustments to prior years in 2024, the effective tax rate is 28.1%. Deferred tax is detailed in note 25.

## Profit after taxation

The profit after taxation for the year ended 31 December 2024 was £26.0 million (2023: £27.9 million).

## Alternative performance (non-GAAP) financial measures

We have provided alternative financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted International Accounting Standards ('IFRS'). We use these alternative financial measures internally in analysing our financial results and believe they are useful to investors, as a supplement to IFRS measures, in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. We believe that the use of these alternative financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends in comparing our financial results with other companies in the industry, many of which present similar alternative financial measures to investors.

Alternative financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with IFRS. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these alternative financial measures to their most directly comparable IFRS financial measures provided in the financial statements table.

## Return on capital employed

Return on capital employed (ROCE) is the ratio of the group's adjusted EBIT to total assets less cash, capital investments made in the last 12 months and current liabilities. In the current year the calculation annualises the EBIT of the VHG acquisition as it was not part of the group for the full year. The calculation of return on capital employed is shown below:

## Adjusted free cash flow

Adjusted FCF (Free Cash Flow) is calculated as adjusted EBITDA, less rent, capital expenditure cash flows and changes in working capital after adjusting for one-off items which are not related to the normal trading activity of the business. Rent cash flows are defined as interest on, and payment of, lease liabilities. Capital expenditure cash flows are defined as the purchase of plant, property and equipment. The calculation of readjusted free cash flow is shown below:

## Closing cash balance

The group's year end cash balance stood at £41.2 million, which reflects a reduction of £8.4 million against the prior year balance of £49.6 million. The reduction in cash is largely due to increased capital expenditure of £27.7 million offset by proceeds from the Tunbridge Wells proceeds of £10.0 million. There is £5.4 million of capital expenditure related to solar panels, for which we expect to convert and enter into a sale and leaseback agreement in early 2025 and therefore represents a timing difference on cash. Further detailed information on the cash flow during the period is set out in the following sections.

## Operating cash flows before adjusting items

The cash inflow from operating activities before tax, adjusting items was £244.3 million (2023: £228.2 million), which constitutes a cash conversion rate from £260.0 million adjusted EBITDA of 94% (2023: 98% conversion of £232.2 million adjusted EBITDA). The net cash outflow from movements in working capital in the period was £7.0 million (2023: £15.5 million outflow).

## Investing and financing cash flows

Net cash outflow in investing activities for the period was £99.0 million (2023: £157.2 million). The cash outflow relates to the purchase of plant, property and equipment in the period totalled £112.1 million (2023: £84.4 million). Capital investments in the year includes major refurbishments at Spire Portsmouth and Spire Washington; energy savings initiatives including solar panel installations; and new MRI scanners. We also deployed an accelerated growth investment supporting the Primary Care expansion strategy, including the openings of Spire Clinics in Abergele, Harrogate and Norwich.

Net cash used in financing activities for the period was £145.1 million (2023: £82.9 million). Cash outflows include interest paid and other financing costs of £98.1 million (2023: £90.0 million), and £26.2 million (2023: £27.2 million) of lease liability payments, a final dividend payment of £8.5 million and £3.1 million for the buyback of shares to settle share awards and £3.1 million for share cancellation to return value to shareholders.

The financial covenants and agreement terms relating to this agreement are unchanged, with leverage to be below 4.0x and interest cover to be in excess of 4.0x. As at 31 December 2024 the leverage measure stood at 2.0x (2023:2.2x) and interest cover of 7.5x (2023: 8.5x).

As at 31 December 2024 lease liabilities were £912.8 million (2023: £891.7 million).

## Dear shareholder,

I am pleased to introduce the governance report in a year where Spire has continued to deliver on its strategy, across our financial, quality and people targets. This encouraging performance is testament to Spire's culture: one that is characterised by openness, respect, collaborative working, a focus on clinical safety and a spirit of continuous improvement.

Spire's purpose is to make a positive difference to people's lives through outstanding personalised care. Spire is achieving this by running excellent hospitals, and developing primary care services to provide people with more choice and the opportunity to access the healthcare they need.

Our market fundamentals remain strong. Spire continues to play an important role in the NHS and is part of the new NHS partnership with the independent sector. Through its range of integrated services, Spire is meeting growing healthcare demand in the UK, building a healthier and more productive population.

## Governance structure

We operate two principal committees for governance below the board; the clinical governance and safety committee (CGS), which runs a ward to board structure of controls, reviews clinical quality, and the audit and risk committee (ARC) which covers risk and financial controls.

## Quality and safety

The board maintained a relentless focus on quality and safety, which is integrated into every aspect of the business, delivering continuous improvement. The board welcomed the implementation of the new Patient Safety Incident Response Framework (PSIRF) across the hospitals business in 2024, resulting in a step change in our culture and approach to patient safety incidents.

## Audit and risk

The full report of the audit chair is on page 105, but it was with great sorrow that we announced that Martin Angle, deputy chairman and independent non-executive director, passed away in September 2024. Martin was a member of the board from 2019, was chair of the ARC and a member of CGS, nomination, and remuneration committees. Recruitment of his replacement is complete and I would like to thank Debbie White, our senior independent director, who has stepped in to cover the role in the interim.

## Board changes

I was pleased to welcome Harbant Samra as chief financial officer after Jitesh Sodha stepped down from the board in May 2024. Harbant joined Spire Healthcare in 2018 as a group financial controller and became deputy CFO in 2022.

In May 2025, Dame Professor Janet Husband will step down from the board after 11 years chairing the CGS committee. We will miss her expertise and I am grateful for all she has done to drive strong clinical governance and a steep improvement in safety and culture during her tenure.

I am happy to announce that both Jill Anderson and Sir David Sloman will join us as non executive directors in March. Jill, who has a strong financial background, principally as a divisional chief financial officer at GSK plc, will take over from Debbie as chair of the ARC after the AGM in May 2025. Sir David will take over from Dame Janet as chair of CGS after the AGM in May 2025. Sir David is the former COO of the NHS and has had an extensive career in the NHS as hospital and regional CEO. He will bring a depth of healthcare governance experience to the board. As a result of Sir David's appointment with AXA UK and Ireland, the company does not consider him to be independent.

## Looking ahead

Looking ahead, the board is confident that Spire can continue to deliver on its strategy and is well positioned to meet structural market growth. The work to transform the business during 2024 has laid the groundwork for further transformation, savings and margin improvement in 2025, and the outlook for the business is strong. The business has responded well to a changing market and economic developments by accelerating efficiencies and managing acuity, mix and pricing.

As the business continues to integrate healthcare offerings, Spire will accelerate the benefits of offering primary and secondary care services to provide a platform for growth and deliver sustainable shareholder value. Its progress is to the credit of the board, executive team, excellent management team and colleagues across the group, who have all contributed to Spire's growth in 2024.

## Corporate governance report

## Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code in 2024

The 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code (the 'Code') provides the standard for corporate governance in the UK. The Financial Conduct Authority requires listed companies to disclose whether they have complied with the provisions of the Code throughout the financial year under review.

The company has complied with the principles and provisions of the Code, throughout the year except as shown in the following table.

|   Code provision | HowhastheCompany not complied with the provisionsoftheUKCode?                              | The Board's response                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

## Director independence

Independence is determined by ensuring that, apart from receiving their fees for acting as directors or owning shares, non-executive directors do not have any other material relationship or additional remuneration from, or transactions with, the group, its promoters, its management or its subsidiaries, which in the judgement of the board may affect, or could appear to affect, their independence of judgement.

The company does not consider Dr Ronnie van der Merwe, who has been nominated to act as a non-executive director by Mediclinic Group Limited, the company's principal shareholder, to be independent. Mediclinic Group Limited's subsidiary, Mediclinic Jersey Limited (formerly Remgro Jersey Limited), entered into a relationship agreement with the company in June 2015 (the 'Relationship Agreement'). Under the terms of the Relationship Agreement, when Mediclinic International Limited controls 15% or more of the votes, it will be entitled to appoint one non-executive director to the board.

It controls 29.9% of votes as at 5 March 2025. The directors believe that the terms of the Relationship Agreement will enable the group to carry on its business independently of Mediclinic Group Limited.

The board considers that, excluding the chairman, over half of the board is independent of management and free from any business or other relationship that could affect the exercise of their independent judgement.

## Workforce engagement

The board has appointed the remuneration committee to monitor workforce engagement and report to the board on the progress of Spire Healthcare's workforce initiatives, together with the challenges, concerns and priorities of colleagues. This provides directors with an understanding into how culture is embedded across hospitals and central functions, and any issues to be addressed.

## Conflicts of interest

Save as set out below, there are no actual or potential conflicts of interest between any duties owed by the directors or senior management to the company and their private interests or other duties. The board will continue to monitor and review potential conflicts of interest on a regular basis.

## Director

Dr Ronnie van der Merwe

## Conflict

Chief executive officer of Mediclinic Group Limited, which controls 29.9% of the voting rights in the company as at 5 March 2025.

## Changes to your board during 2024

In early 2024, Jitesh Sodha decided that he wished to step down from the board and did not seek re-election by the company's shareholders at the annual general meeting on 9 May 2024. Harbant Samra was appointed chief financial officer from this date.

Martin Angle, Deputy Chairman and independent Non-Executive Director, sadly passed away in September 2024.

## Principal decisions of the board during 2024

Throughout this annual report, we provide examples of how the company takes into account the likely consequences of long-term decisions; builds relationships with stakeholders; understands the importance of engaging with our colleagues; understands the impact of our operations on the communities in our region and the environment we depend upon; and attributes importance to behaving as a responsible business. The directors recognise the importance of effective stakeholder engagement and that stakeholders' views should be considered in its decision-making.

## Board and committee structure

Ultimate responsibility for the management of the group rests with the board of directors. The board focuses primarily upon strategic and policy issues and is responsible for:

- Leadership of the group
- Implementing and monitoring effective controls to assess and manage risk
- Supporting the senior leadership team to formulate and execute the group's strategy

The agenda at scheduled meetings in 2024 covered standing agenda items, including: a review of the group's performance from the chief executive officer; the current month's and year-to-date financial statistics from the chief financial officer; and a review of clinical performance and medical governance by both the group clinical director and group medical director. In addition, the board received a verbal report from committee chairs, where their committee met immediately in advance of the scheduled board meeting, and the board regularly received reports on legal and statutory matters.

- Monitoring the performance of the group
- Setting the group's values and standards

There is a specific schedule of matters reserved for the board.

## The non-executive directors

The non-executive directors bring a wide range of skills and experience to the board. The independent non-executive directors represent a strong, independent element on the board and are well placed to constructively challenge and support management. They help to shape the group's strategy, scrutinise the performance of management in meeting the group's objectives and monitor the reporting of performance.

Their role is also to satisfy themselves with regard to the integrity of the group's financial information and to ensure that the group's internal controls and risk management systems are robust and defensible.

The independent non-executive directors oversee the adequacy of the risk management and internal control systems (from their membership of the audit and risk committee, and clinical governance and safety committee), as well as the remuneration for the executive directors (from their membership of the remuneration committee).

As members of the nomination committee, the non-executive directors also play a pivotal role in board succession planning and the appointment of new executive directors.

## Your board in 2024

The principal decisions of the board during the year can be found on page 91.

Board meetings were held in person during the year and director attendance at scheduled meetings is shown on page 97.

## The board's plan for 2025

It is currently planned that the board will convene for seven scheduled meetings in 2025, as well as holding any necessary ad hoc board and committee meetings to consider non-routine business.

The chairman and the other non-executive directors will meet on their own without the executive directors present. In addition, the senior independent director and other non-executive directors will meet without the chairman present to discuss matters such as the chairman's performance.

The board will maintain its focus on the group's pursuit of its 2025 targets during the year. Its activities will include:

- Reviewing and approving the 2024 annual report
- Reviewing the revised five-year strategic plan and approving the 2025 annual operating plan
- Completing deep dives into key areas of the business
- Embedding the risk management framework
- Reviewing the makeup of the board
- Following a rolling agenda, ensuring proper time for strategic debate

Furthermore, the board will maintain its commitment to continuous improvement of clinical quality and the use of Quality Improvement methodology. It will maintain overall responsibility for the group's system of internal control and risk management processes via the relevant board committees.

## Disclosure committee

The board has established a disclosure committee to ensure, under delegated authority, that the company complies with its disclosure obligations, specifically under the Market Abuse Regulation and related legislation. The disclosure committee also manages the company's share dealing code, ensuring colleague compliance and provides training where required. The members of the disclosure committee are shown on page 95.

## Share schemes committee

In addition, the board delegates certain responsibilities in relation to the administration of the company's share schemes on an ad hoc basis to the share schemes committee. This committee operates in accordance with the delegation of authority agreed by the board.

## Executive committee

The executive committee meets twice a month, splitting its time between project work and strategic matters. The executive committee delegates certain matters to the safety, quality and risk committee which has specific focus on safety, quality and risk matters (see the governance framework on page 95).

## National medical professional standards committee

The national medical professional standards committee meets monthly and is chaired by the group medical director, with membership including the group clinical director, chief operating officer (deputy chair), associate medical directors, director of integrated quality governance and legal advisor.

The purpose of the national medical professional standards committee is to:

- Have oversight of performance and monitoring of safety standards of consultants and GPs with practising privileges or employed by Spire Healthcare
- Have oversight over the investigations relating to the practice of doctors with practising privileges at Spire Healthcare's facilities in order to provide assurance to the executive committee and board in relation to compliance with medical policies relating to professional standards
- Provide oversight of consultant-related Patient Notification Exercises in order to promote and maintain good medical practice, and inform the continuous quality improvement programme across Spire Healthcare
- Ensure that local and organisational learning is determined and actioned in relation to medical professional standards and performance

## Board meetings

The attendance of the directors who served during the year ended 31 December 2024, and meetings of the board during 2024, are shown on page 97. To the extent that directors are unable to attend scheduled meetings, or additional meetings called on short notice, they will receive the papers in advance and relay their comments to the chairman for communication at the meeting. The chairman will follow up after the meeting in relation to both the discussions held and decisions taken.

## Effectiveness

## Board composition

The board seeks to ensure that both it and its committees have the appropriate range of skills, experience, independence and knowledge of the group to enable them to discharge their respective duties and responsibilities effectively; for example, the 2024 board calendar included sessions on clinical data analysis and statutory regulations. The board considers its size and composition to be appropriate for the current requirements of the business but will continue to keep this under review.

Committee composition is set out in the relevant committee reports and listed on page 95. No one other than committee chairs and members of the committees is entitled to participate in meetings of the audit and risk, CGSC, disclosure, nomination and remuneration committees, unless by invitation of the respective committee chair.

Debbie White is the Senior Independent Director. Biographical details of the directors are set out on pages 98 to 99.

## Appointments to the board

Recommendations for appointments to the board are made by the nomination committee. As part of the recruitment process the nomination committee follows a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure. Further information is set out in the nomination committee report on page 101.

## Time commitment of the non-executive directors

The non-executive directors each have a letter of appointment which sets out the terms and conditions of their directorship. An indication of the anticipated time commitment is provided in any recruitment role specification, and each director's letter of appointment provides details of the meetings that they are expected to attend.

Non-executive directors are required to set aside sufficient time to prepare for meetings, and to regularly refresh and update their skills and knowledge. In signing their letters of appointment, all directors have agreed to commit sufficient time for the proper performance of their responsibilities, acknowledging that this will vary from year to year, depending on the group's activities.

Directors are expected to attend all board and committee meetings, and any additional meetings, as required. Each director's other significant commitments were disclosed to the board at the time of their appointment and they are required to notify the board of any subsequent changes. The group has reviewed the availability of the non-executive directors and considers that each of them is able to, and in practice does, devote the necessary amount of time to the group's business.

## Induction and training

Generally, reference materials are provided, including information about the board, its committees, directors' duties, procedures for dealing in the group's shares and other regulatory and governance matters, and directors are advised of their legal and other duties, and obligations as directors of a listed company.

On joining the board, it is the responsibility of the chairman and company secretary to ensure that all newly appointed directors receive a full and formal induction which is tailored to their individual needs. The induction programme includes a comprehensive overview of the group, dedicated time with other directors and senior management, as well as guidance on the duties, responsibilities and liabilities as a director of a listed and regulated company. These activities will form part of the induction programmes for Sir David Sloman and Jill Anderson once in role.

The company secretary ensures that any additional request for information is promptly supplied. The chairman, through the company secretary, ensures that there is an ongoing process to review any internal or external training and development needs.

As already noted, in the event of a general training need, in-house training will be provided to the entire board. Necessary and relevant regulatory updates are provided by the group general counsel and company secretary or by external advisers as required.

## Information and support

The board ensures that it receives, in a timely manner, information of an appropriate quality to enable it to adequately discharge its responsibilities. This is aided by the use of an online portal. Papers are provided to the directors in advance of the relevant board or committee meeting to enable them to make further enquiries about any matters prior to the meeting, should they so wish. This also allows directors who are unable to attend to submit views in advance of the meeting.

Outside the board papers process, the executive directors provide written updates to the non-executive directors on important business issues, including financial and commercial information. In addition, relevant updates on shareholder matters (including analysts' reports) are also provided to the board.

All directors have access to the advice and services of the company secretary. There is also an agreed procedure in place for directors, in the furtherance of their duties, to take independent legal advice, if necessary, at the group's expense.

Corporate governance report continued

## Election and re-election of directors

All the directors appointed at the time offered themselves for re-election at the tenth annual general meeting in May 2024 with the exception of Jitesh Sodha who did not stand for re-election. Directors are elected or re-elected in accordance with the requirements of the Code.

All of the company's directors, with the exception of Dame Janet Husband who will step down from the board, will stand for re-election at the annual general meeting in May 2025.

The biographical details of each director standing for election or re-election is included in the 2025 notice of annual general meeting. The board believes that each of the directors standing for election or re-election is effective and demonstrates commitment to their respective roles. Accordingly, the board recommends that shareholders approve the resolutions to be proposed at the 2025 annual general meeting relating to the election and re-election of the directors.

The biographical details of all directors are set out on pages 98 to 99.

## Directors' indemnities

The directors of the company have the benefit of a third-party indemnity provision, as defined by section 236 of the Companies Act 2006, in the group's articles of association. In addition, directors and officers of the group are covered by directors' and officers' liability insurance.

## Directors' conflicts of interest

The Companies Act 2006 provides that directors must avoid a situation where they have, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with a company's interests. Directors of public companies may authorise conflicts and potential conflicts, where appropriate, if a company's articles of association permit.

Overview

Strategic report

Governance report

Financial statements

Other information

The board has established formal procedures to authorise situations where a director has an interest that conflicts, or may possibly conflict, with the interests of the company - Situational Conflicts. Directors declare Situational Conflicts, so that they can be considered for authorisation by the non-conflicted directors.

The audit and risk committee and the clinical governance and safety committee, whose reports are set out on pages 105 to 110 and pages 103 to 104 respectively, assist the board in reviewing the effectiveness of the group's risk management system and internal controls, including financial, clinical, operational and compliance controls.

In considering a Situational Conflict, these directors act in the way they consider would be most likely to promote the success of the group, and may impose limits, or conditions, when giving authorisation or, subsequently, if they think this is appropriate.

The company secretary records the consideration of any conflict and any authorisations granted. The board believes that the system it has in place for reporting Situational Conflicts continues to operate effectively.

## Non-executive director engagement with hospitals

Non-executive directors, particularly the members of the clinical governance and safety committee are regular attendees at a wide range of hospital briefings, meetings and specialist conferences. These events have included local and national meetings, and the national medical professional standards committee. Directors have also attended the national theatre managers conference and the national pharmacy managers conference, as well as conferences for directors of clinical services and critical care, and cardiology specialists.

## Accountability

## The audit and risk committee

The audit and risk committee report is set out on pages 105 to 110, and identifies its members, whose biographies are set out on pages 98 and 99.

The report describes the audit and risk committee's work in discharging its responsibilities during the year ended 31 December 2024, and its terms of reference can be found on the group's website at www.investors.spirehealthcare.com.

## Risk management and internal control

The board has overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining a sound system of risk management and internal control, and for reviewing its effectiveness. This system is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risks facing the group and safeguard its assets. No system of internal control can provide absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. The group's system is designed to provide the directors with reasonable assurance that issues are identified on a timely basis and are dealt with appropriately.

## Executive compensation and risk

Only independent non-executive directors are allowed to serve on the audit and risk committee and remuneration committee. The non-executive directors are therefore able to bring their experience and knowledge of the activities of each committee to bear when considering the critical judgements of the other.

This means that the directors are in a position to consider carefully the impact of incentive arrangements on the group's risk profile and to ensure the group's remuneration policy and programme are structured, so as to accord with the long-term objectives and risk appetite of the group.

## Financial and non-financial risk

The clinical governance and safety committee, with the audit and risk committee, collectively ensure that the control and monitoring of both financial and non-financial risks is satisfactory.

In addition, both committees seek to ensure, as far as practicable, there are no elements omitted or unnecessarily duplicated, and that all critical judgements receive the correct level of challenge.

## Relations with shareholders

The board is committed to communicating with shareholders and stakeholders in a clear and open manner, and seeks to ensure effective engagement through the group's regular communications, the annual general meeting and other investor relations activities.

The group undertakes an ongoing programme of meetings with investors, which during 2024 was led by the chief executive officer, chief financial officer and the director of investor relations. The non-executive chairman, senior independent director and committee chairs remain available for discussion with shareholders on matters under their areas of responsibility, either through contacting the company secretary or directly at the annual general meeting.

The company reports its financial results to shareholders twice a year, with the publication of its annual and half yearly financial reports.

Overview

Corporate governance report continued

In conjunction with these announcements, presentations or teleconference calls are held with institutional investors and analysts, and copies of any presentation materials issued are made available through the company's website at www.investors.spirehealthcare.com.

## Modern slavery

Spire Healthcare Group is committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all our relationships, in line with our value of 'Doing the right thing'. Our approach to tackling the risk of modern slavery continues to evolve under the oversight of our sustainability committee, which reports to our executive committee to ensure that our directors have full oversight on all relevant matters.

Our two main areas of focus are: a) to safeguard patients, colleagues and others who come through our facilities; and b) in our supply chain. In our business operations, we believe practitioners and colleagues are well-placed to identify and deal with modern slavery concerns through the safeguarding training and protections we have in place. The safeguarding system trains those practitioners and other colleagues (clinical and non-clinical) to recognise and report signs of abuse.

Governance report

Financial statements

We believe the rigour of this system mitigates the risk of modern slavery from either going undetected or being dealt with inadequately. This risk is further controlled by the support, training and infrastructure in place for all colleagues to be able to raise concerns through our network of Freedom to Speak Up Guardians, or other available channels. In 2024, we:

- Maintained our modern slavery due diligence process for new suppliers with an annual spend in excess of £1 million. There were no issues identified through this process
- Continued to apply our procurement policy, which ensures that our hospitals and clinics are equipped with guidance and a risk assessment tool for evaluating modern slavery risks in local contracts
- Continued supplier and product rationalisation initiatives, focusing our attention on increasing the proportion of spend with longstanding reputable suppliers, with whom satisfactory due diligence has been carried out
- Reviewed the merits of procuring a third-party supplier risk management solution and determined, at this stage, not to progress further as we considered our internal processes to be adequate

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has introduced a requirement for listed companies to report on new board diversity targets and provide data on the gender and ethnic diversity of the board and in its executive management. Following the FCA's definition, executive management for these purposes, means the members of our executive committee. However, we have included board members who are also in executive management only in the board members column, and not in the executive management column, in the below tables. We are committed to improving diversity across all protected characteristics and will continue to make progress in line with the new requirements from the FCA.

Nomination committee members' biographies are shown on pages 98 to 99.

Martin Angle, a former member of the committee, sadly passed away in September 2024.

The Nomination Committee's terms of reference can be found at www.investors. spirehealthcare.com

## Role and responsibilities

The nomination committee's foremost priorities are to ensure that the group has the best possible leadership and to plan for both executive and non-executive director succession. Its prime focus is therefore on the composition of the board, for which appointments will be made on merit against objective criteria. The nomination committee advises the board on these appointments, oversees the recruitment processes, and also considers retirements and resignations from the board and its other committees. The nomination committee regularly examines succession planning based on the board's balance of experience, overall diversity and the leadership skills required to deliver the company's strategy.

## Process for board appointments

While making new appointments to the board on merit, the board will actively seek to secure candidates with a diverse background. Appointments will take account of the specific skills and experience, resilience, independence and knowledge needed to ensure a rounded board and the diverse benefits each candidate can bring to its overall composition. Care is taken to ensure that proposed appointees have sufficient time to devote to the role and any conflicts of interest are identified and subsequently authorised by the board.

The nomination committee uses the services of an executive search firm to identify appropriate candidates, ensuring that the search firm appointed does not have any other conflicts with the group. In addition, the nomination committee will only use those firms that have adopted the Voluntary Code of Conduct addressing gender diversity and best practice in search assignments. A long list of potential appointees is reviewed, followed by the shortlisting of candidates for interview based upon the objective criteria identified in the specification. Committee members interview the shortlisted candidates together with other directors as appropriate, and identify a preferred candidate. Following these meetings, and subject to satisfactory references, the nomination committee makes a formal recommendation to the board on the appointment.

Annual Report and Accounts 2024

Nomination committee report continued

## Dear shareholder,

I am pleased to present the nomination committee's report for the year ended 31 December 2024.

## New appointments to the board

Following the unexpected and sad passing of Martin Angle, and planning in the event that Dame Janet Husband decided to step down from the board, the nomination committee commenced two separate recruitment exercises during the second half of 2024. Dame Janet confirmed her intention to step down from the board in March 2025 and she will not seek re-election at our annual general meeting in May. The aim of the recruitment processes was to identify two nonexecutive directors who could chair our audit and risk committee, and clinical governance and safety committee, and bring a new perspective to our boardroom. The process for each search, which culminated in a recommendation to the board to appoint two outstanding candidates in Jill Anderson and Sir David Sloman, is set out below.

In both appointments, the committee first agreed the appointment of an executive search firm to assist in the process. It determined, on these occasions, to engage The Inzito Partnership and Odgers Berndtson to assist with the search for the chair of the audit and risk committee and chair of the clinical governance and safety committee respectively. These appointments were based on their previous experience in delivering similar roles, and their knowledge and access to diverse candidates in the marketplace.

We met with the representatives of each appointed firm to discuss a detailed brief for the roles. The chair of the audit and risk committee required recent and relevant financial experience, ideally in a listed environment, and the chair of the clinical governance and safety committee needed a strong healthcare background, although it was determined that this did not need to be clinical experience. From this, each search firm proposed a short list of candidates who met with members of the committee and, where appropriate, executive management. Following this first stage assessment, a reduced list of candidates met with other members of the board. The candidates for the chair of the clinical governance and safety committee also met with our group clinical director and group medical director.

As chair of the nomination committee, I gathered and assessed the feedback from the assessment process, and recommended to the nomination committee a preferred candidate for each role. The nomination committee then reviewed the recommendation and agreed recommendations to the board.

## Future succession planning and appointments to the board

All changes to the board and its committees are overseen by the nomination committee. Strong succession planning remains a key focus to help ensure that we continue to have an appropriate mix of skills, experience and backgrounds on the company's board and in its senior leadership team.

We recognise the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 (the 'Code') in our decision-making, while assessing the cultural and capabilities that will help the group deliver its strategic aims. We remain committed to making appointments on merit, based on objective criteria, but we set that against a clear strategy to promote diversity across the business.

Diversity and inclusion is a major focus of activity across Spire Healthcare, and will continue to be in the years ahead. The board promotes diversity and inclusivity within the organisation, including supporting women to become leaders in the business and improving the diversity of the company's workforce. We believe that a diverse board includes and makes good use of differences in skills, experience, background, ethnicity, gender and other characteristics. Our aim was to achieve a minimum 33% female representation on the board by our AGM in May 2023 and 40% by 2025. We were delighted to have achieved our 2025 target, with a gender split on our board of 50% male and 50% female.

We also consider the tenure of board members and potential future board retirements, and the impact of these on membership of the board and its committees.

The committee's remit includes an ongoing review of the structure, size and composition of the board and its committees to ensure we maintain the appropriate mix of knowledge, skills, experience, and diversity.

## Independence and time commitments

Based on our assessment during 2024, the committee is satisfied that, throughout the year, all independent non-executive directors remained independent in character and judgement.

In recommending directors for election and re-election at the annual general meeting, the committee reviews the performance of each non-executive director and their ability to continue meeting the time commitments required, taking into consideration individual capabilities, skills and experiences and any potential conflicts of interest that have been disclosed. While some of our directors have other significant commitments outside of Spire Healthcare, these are considered to be appropriate and not to conflict with their responsibilities to the group.

## Diversity and inclusion

Our board diversity policy and our wider equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) strategy puts four commitments at the heart of our approach:

1. We recognise the value of diversity.
2. We understand how it will help us deliver our purpose.
3. We respect and appreciate each other for who we are.
4. We include diverse colleagues in our problem-solving to make better, faster decisions.

Spire Healthcare continues to employ a large majority of female colleagues and the company's gender pay gap compares favourably to other organisations. However, we recognise we can do more to achieve better gender representation at senior leadership levels. Details of the company's staff diversity and gender pay gap, in line with reporting requirements, can be found on page 48. The chart on page 97 also illustrates the diversity of the board in terms of gender.

I am pleased to confirm that the company complies with the Listing Rule changes brought about by the FCA's policy statement on diversity and inclusion on boards that at least 40% of the board should be women; at least one of the senior board positions (chair, chief executive officer, chief financial officer or senior independent director) should be a woman; and at least one member of the board should be from an ethnic minority background, excluding white ethnic groups.

## Performance evaluation

In late 2024, the committee completed its annual performance evaluation, which was led by Debbie White (as the senior independent director) supported by the company secretary and an external specialist, BoardClic, who together created a comprehensive set of questionnaires based on best practice and regulatory guidelines for the board and each board committee. In reviewing the matters identified in BoardClic's report on the outcome of the review, the committee chair discussed and agreed to prepare an action plan for 2025 that took into consideration elements of the report on future board composition.

## Re-election of directors

The committee met in early 2025 to review the continuation in office and potential reappointment of members of the board, as described earlier. Following this review, the committee recommended to the board that all directors standing be reappointed or have their appointments confirmed, and hence these directors will seek election or re-election at the annual general meeting in May.

## Role and responsibilities

The CGSC sits above the group's clinical governance systems and is charged by the board with ensuring effective systems and processes are in place to review clinical performance, including the management of complaints, safeguarding concerns, whistleblowing and freedom to speak up issues.

The responsibilities of the CGSC include:

- Promoting a culture of high-quality and safe patient care and experience
- Reviewing the group medical director's report
- Reviewing the group clinical director's clinical governance and safety reports
- Monitoring patient health and safety matters
- Reviewing governance matters that impact patient safety
- Reviewing the clinical matters on the whistleblowing register
- Promoting continuous clinical improvements
- Holding the executive committee accountable for following up actions

Overview

Clinical governance and safety committee report continued

## Dear shareholder,

I am pleased to present the clinical governance and safety committee's report for the year ended 31 December 2024.

Our role is the robust assurance of governance of clinical quality at Spire Healthcare. Quality underpins everything we do and is a core pillar of our strategy, with the delivery of patient safety and highquality patient care central to our operations and embedded in our purpose and culture.

Our Quality Improvement (QI) programme reflects our continuous improvement approach to safety and quality. We have linked it to the implementation of the Patient Safety Incident Response Framework (PSIRF) to encourage faster and more embedded learning across the group. Spire's agreed QI priorities for 2024 included reducing incidents, and improving recognition and care of, venous thromboembolism (VTE). All hospitals now have a VTE lead and have VTE quarterly committee meetings. The committee agrees that avoidable VTEs would be an important step forward in understanding issues and whether hospitals could have taken any additional action. Read more about our QI priorities and PSIRF on page 25 and page 26.

Our new clinical effectiveness and outcomes framework sits alongside a range of toolkits designed to support hospitals and I believe they will help us to drive clinical improvement and provide benchmarking.

## Meetings and seminars in 2024

Our four regular meetings over the year cover oversight of Spire Healthcare's clinical governance, as well as medical professional standards, clinical risk and the clinical aspects of health and safety. We take a strategic and balanced approach to the material and data presented to us, and in our meeting discussions.

We were pleased to continue welcoming non-clinical board members to our meetings as observers. This gives important exposure to how the committee is managing clinical governance. We also welcomed a range of colleagues and external visitors to present data and feedback, which helps to widen the board's understanding of the core clinical and safety issues and challenges that we face.

Over 2024, PSIRF has been implemented across all Spire hospitals. The committee has heard at meetings how sites such as Spire Southampton and Bristol are embedding PSIRF and its positive effects on colleague learning, consultant engagement and engagement on incident reviews. I am impressed and encouraged by how Spire has embraced PSIRF across all three nations in which we operate and for every patient, beyond our obligations to NHS patients in England.

Strategic report

Governance report

Financial statements

Other information

It has had wider impacts, with senior leadership teams and practising consultants more involved in governance at each hospital, as well as improved relationships between our central clinical team and the directors of clinical services at each hospital. I am extremely grateful to Dr Cathy Cale, Group Medical Director, for spearheading the PSIRF programme throughout our hospitals business, and for her wider support over 2024.

## Maintaining our high quality standards

At our June meeting, we heard from Professor Lisa Grant, Group Clinical Director and Chief Nurse, who has spearheaded Spire's nursing and allied health professionals strategy. I am confident that this strategy will help to develop the clinical workforce, deliver outstanding patient care and excellence, and enhance professional pride. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Lisa for her outstanding work in driving excellence at Spire, as well as her important support and guidance this year.

Developing clinical excellence in all our services is central to Spire's ongoing success. In September, Phil Adkins, Director of Clinical Services, Vita Health Group, presented its quality and safety report to the committee for the first time and explained how Spire's mental health, musculoskeletal and occupational health services are helping to address the causes of sickness absence from work and mortality rates in the UK.

As part of our seminar series, the committee welcomed a visit from Professor Dame Carol Black in 2024, a leading physician and academic whose prestigious career roles have included presidency of the Royal College of Physicians and adviser to the government on the relationship between work and health, including leading its new occupational health taskforce. She spoke to the committee about health and productivity in the workplace, the data trends and common themes and actions to improve wellbeing of workers. This is relevant to the committee's oversight of Spire's expanding primary care services.

## Committee engagement

Over the past year, the clinical NEDs of the committee visited 17 hospital sites, including Spire Southampton, Norwich, St Anthony's in Cheam, Clare Park in Farnham, and Wellesley in Southend. These visits are an extremely important part of our role and also serve to motivate and support local teams to continue providing excellent patient care. We also attended Spire's capital markets day, the MAC Chair bi-annual meeting and other relevant meetings across the business. We were particularly pleased to attend the Driving Clinical Excellence in Practice awards ceremony to recognise colleagues' achievements. Read more on this programme on pages 28 and 45.

In 2024, 98% of our inspected hospitals and clinics are rated 'Good' or 'Outstanding' or the equivalent by regulators in England, Scotland and Wales. We are still awaiting reinspection of Spire Alexandra in Kent, which has not been inspected since 2016/17. All inspected VHG locations are currently rated 100% 'good' by CQC. Our 2024 patient survey showed 97% of our patients rated their experience as 'very good' or 'good', while 95% of patients said they felt 'cared for' or 'looked after' in our hospitals

Detailed key performance indicators report trends and flag any statistical alerts to ensure we focus on the most pertinent areas of clinical governance for our hospitals. These are scrutinised in-depth by the committee. Subjects include incidents of VTE, infection control, patient safety initiatives and mortality. Our newly established safety, quality and risk (SQR) operational group will allow a more strategic approach to SQR under revised terms of reference. The committee also welcomed the introduction of excellence in care safety dashboards, which allow us to oversee safety and quality, and improve how we benchmark hospitals.

We had no changes to our committee structure over the year, but we were shocked and saddened by the unexpected death of Martin Angle in 2024 and will miss his valuable contributions and perspectives as a non-clinical member of the committee. As a supporter of the clinical agenda, he played a vital role in bridging the gap between clinical and business issues.

I would like to recognise and thank all colleagues for what we have achieved and where we are today. After 11 years of chairing the CGSC, I will be stepping down in May. In my time here, I have seen huge change and am so grateful to have been part of Spire's evolving programme of continual quality improvement in pursuit of excellence. I wish Sir David Sloman all the very best in taking forward the vital role of clinical oversight at Spire Healthcare.

Annual Report and Accounts 2024

Audit and risk committee report continued

## Dear shareholder,

As interim chair of the audit and risk committee (the 'committee'), I am pleased to present our report for the year ended 31 December 2024.

It was with deep sadness that we learned of the passing of our dear friend and colleague, Martin Angle, in September 2024. Martin became the chair of this committee in May 2023 and was a highly respected, valued and trusted member of this committee and our board. He was a personal friend to all of us on the committee and many others at Spire Healthcare. We have sorely missed his advice, insights and leadership.

Following a considered search process, Jill Anderson will join Spire as a non executive director in March and take over as chair of the committee after the AGM in May 2025. Jill, has a strong financial background, principally as a divisional chief financial officer at GSK plc. More information on the recruitment process can be found in the nomination committee report on page 102.

## Risk management and internal controls

Risk management continues to be an area of focus and scrutiny for the committee at each meeting, with papers presented and discussed in detail to understand key issues raised and identify emerging and significant risks to the business and the plans to mitigate them.

## Internal audit function

The committee receives an update report from the director of audit, risk and compliance on internal audit activity four times a year, with two of the committee meetings reserved for deep dives into specific risk or internal control matters. In each update, the committee receives the executive summary of recently published internal audit reports, and the chair receives the full internal audit report. The committee also receives a status update of any remedial actions agreed with management. If there are significant findings, the committee asks the appropriate senior management to attend to discuss the findings.

KPMG stepped down as our internal audit service provider after completing the 2024 internal audit plan (which did not directly conflict with any of the services it provided). The committee ran a tender for internal audit services and RSM was successful in winning the tender and will provide internal audit services from 2025 under a three-year contract.

The director of audit, risk and compliance, under international internal audit standards, has to declare to the committee any potential compromises on his independence. This may include other 'control' functions for which he has line management responsibility. The committee has to approve any activity that falls outside of internal audit. As in prior years, in 2024, the director of audit, risk and compliance had the risk management function reporting into him, with the approval by the committee. On an annual basis the committee reviews the internal audit charter that is based on the Institute of Internal Audit's template charter. The committee also reviewed the compliance by the director of internal audit, risk and compliance with the internal audit code of conduct.

The committee requires KPMG, as the co-source provider of internal audit services, to maintain independence. In 2023, in the best interests of the company, and after full consideration by the committee of any impact on the independence of internal audit services, the committee approved that KPMG provided some additional services to the group, relating to support with the design of its digital strategy. In 2024, the committee agreed, after further careful consideration of the best interests of the company, to an extension of those services.

The 2025 internal audit plan was approved at the November 2024 committee meeting. The plan is prepared on a risk-focused basis with input from the senior leadership team and non-executive directors. For 2025, the plan will focus on some of our larger hospitals, core areas of financial control, clinical governance and cyber security.

## Risk management function

The risk management and internal control report details the changes to the risk environment the group has faced in 2024 (see pages 65 to 76).

To provide visibility of risks from 'ward-to-board', the risk management team provides quarterly reports to:

- The executive committee and the audit and risk committee on principal risks
- The safety, quality and risk committee, and clinical governance and safety committee on clinical quality risks

On a monthly basis, the operations committee reviews hospital level risks.

The committee reviews the risk appetite in relation to the principal risks providing challenge where appropriate on the level of risk the executive wishes to tolerate.

## Emerging risks

During 2024, the committee maintained its focus on the risks, and potential mitigations, that may emerge from the rapidly changing geopolitical and economic environment. The principal risks and emerging risks are discussed in more detail in the risk management and internal control report on pages 65 to 76.

## New financial and internal control reporting requirements

The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) published the revised Corporate Governance Code (2024 Code) in January 2024. The committee monitored developments in the regulatory environment and received reports from management on their readiness to comply with new requirements from 1 January 2026.

The committee received a briefing on the two sustainability financial reporting standards issued by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) in 2023. We await the announcement from the UK government regarding adoption of the standards in the UK.

## Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)

In February 2025, the committee reviewed the TCFD disclosures on pages 77 to 82 and reviewed the process for the preparation of the disclosures in compliance with Listing Rule (UKLR 9.8.6(8)).

## Viability

The committee reviewed the process undertaken by management to support and allow the directors to make the group's viability statement. The committee considered and provided input into the determination which of the group's principal risks and combinations thereof might have an impact on the group's liquidity and solvency. The committee reviewed the results of management's scenario modelling and the stress testing of these models. The group's viability statement can be found on page 83.

## External audit

## Annual auditor appointment

The committee has primary responsibility for the relationship with, and performance of, our external auditor. This includes making the recommendation on the appointment, reappointment and removal of the external auditor, assessing their independence on an ongoing basis, and for negotiating the audit fee in conjunction with the chief financial officer.

The shareholders re-appointed Ernst &amp; Young LLP as the company's external auditor during 2024. Ernst &amp; Young LLP has served the business since 2008. Whilst recognising that the 10-year period of its appointment technically began with the company's admission on the London Stock Exchange in 2014, the committee agreed that a full audit tender should be linked to the end of the previous lead audit partner's term of office in 2020, which is when the last full audit tender occurred. Our current audit partner from Ernst &amp; Young LLP is Stephney Dallmann who took on the role in 2020.

The committee ensures that the external auditor adheres to The Auditing Practices Board's Ethical Standard 3, which requires the rotation of the audit partner for listed companies every five years. As a result the committee noted that this is the fifth and last fiscal year for Stephney Dallmann to serve as the audit partner. Kate Allen will take over as audit partner for the 2025 financial year, and will shadow Stephney for the year end 2024.

## External auditor independence and effectiveness

The committee reviewed the independence and effectiveness of the external auditor. We did this by:

- Reviewing its proposed plan for the 2024 audit
- Discussing the results of its audit, including its views about material accounting issues and key judgements and estimates, and its audit report
- Reviewing the quality of the people and service provided by Ernst &amp; Young LLP
- Evaluating all of the relationships between the external auditor and the group, to determine whether these impair, or appear to impair, the auditor's independence

## Significant issues and material judgements

The audit and risk committee assesses whether suitable accounting policies have been adopted and whether management has made appropriate estimates and judgements.

The committee reviewed the nature of all items classified as 'adjusting items' in the year and management's justification thereof against relevant accounting guidance. Where costs spanned a reporting period, the committee considered the significance of the total expected costs to be incurred across reporting periods (based on management's estimates), when determining the appropriateness of the accounting treatment.

## Other activities in 2024

Prior to the release of the company's 2024 interim results, the committee completed a thorough review of:

- Viability and going concern
- Assessment of goodwill for impairment
- Assessment of property carrying values for impairment
- Assessment of provisions for future liabilities

The committee also reviewed the company's banking covenant compliance.

In addition to providing oversight of the group's financial reporting, internal controls and risk framework, the committee has had reports on information governance from management and external advisors, preparations and planning undertaken in response to the UK Corporate Governance Code update on risk management and internal controls, and counter-fraud initiatives.

The assessment the cash generating units is assessed in line with the relevant accounting principles. The impairment assessment is achieved by comparing the value-in-use of the cash generating unit with its carrying value in the accounts. The value-in-use calculations require the group to estimate future cash flows, considering market conditions, and the present value of these cash flows is determined using an appropriate discount rate. The current value of goodwill is underpinned by these forecasts. | The committee has reviewed in detail the analysis produced by management to assess the carrying value of goodwill as well as the assessment of cash generating units. Its review included assessing for reasonableness the key underlying assumptions used by management in their analysis. These included the discount factor rate, future anticipated growth rates and forecasted levels of capital maintenance investment (excluding expenditure on newor enhancement of assets). The committee noted the discount factor used by management has been reviewed as part of the external audit and falls within the appropriate range given Spire's size and cost of capital. The committee has reviewed management's latest assessments in August 2024 and in February 2025. This regular recurring review process has allowed for earlier visibility of the key assumptions and any potential issues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

These included future anticipated growth rates, the discount factor rate, and levels of ongoing capital maintenance investment (excluding expenditure on newor enhancement of assets). This work was conducted in two phases. An initial review was performed in August 2024 This initial review was performed to provide early visibility of any potential issues and to allow for a preliminary assessment of the reasonableness of the key judgements applied by management. These judgements included: - The terminal growth rate - The discount factor rate - Appropriateness of the determination of a Cash Generating Unit - Forecasts in ongoing capital maintenance - Growth rates applied at an individual hospital level over the next five years Management's review wasupdatedattheyear-end using the latest available forecasts. Ashortlist of hospitals was identified from this activity and reviewed in detail by the committee to ensure that management's conclusions were appropriate. This included, where appropriate, establishing the level of confidence management has in its ability to deliver the plan underlying the forecast. |

| Provision for Paterson claim settlements | Following the publication of the public inquiry report on Ian Paterson on 4 February 2020, the group continues to assess the potential impact of the remedial actions recommended in the report. Since 2020, the group recognised a charge of £28.7 million to ensure the recommended actions are fully adhered to. It is possible that, as further information becomes available, an adjustment to the provision held for claim settlements mayberequired.                          | Per IAS37 (provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets), any provision associated with this matter must represent management's best estimate of the expenditure required to settle that obligation. It is accepted that management's estimate will involve a degree of judgement as it is based upon the information available at the balance sheet date, and that additional or different information mayemerge in the future. The committee reviewed management's estimate and underlying data and assumptions in detail at the time of preparing the 2024 half year results. This exercise included review of key inputs, claim rates and a sensitivity analysis. The on-going appropriateness of the key assumptions was reviewed by the committee as part of the year end process, this was done with reference to actual claims experience since the half year. This review confirmed that management's key judgments and basis for calculating the provision was reasonable and aligned with accounting standards. |
| Adjustments to EBITDA (Adjusting Items)  | It is the group's policy to disclose EBITDA after adjusting for certain items, due to their nature, amount or incidence, in order to provide a meaningful comparison of the group's underlying performance. Group underlying performance is considered the comparable year-on-year business, and therefore excludes items of a one-off or irregular nature. Pressure to achieve targets could lead management to manipulate the outcome by overstating the level of adjusting Items. | The committee: - Reviewed in detail each item which was proposed by management to be classified as an adjusting Item - Assessed whether the proposed approach wasconsistent with prior periods                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Spire Healthcare Group plc

Annual Report and Accounts 2024

Audit and risk committee report continued

## UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) Order

During the year, the company complied with the CMA Order in relation to Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies.

## Audit risk

The committee received from Ernst &amp; Young LLP a detailed plan identifying the scope of their audit for the year, planning materiality and their assessment of key risks. The audit risk identification process is considered a key factor in the overall effectiveness of the external audit process. Ahead of the full-year audit, the committee reviewed the key risks that Ernst &amp; Young LLP identified to ensure their areas of audit focus remain appropriate.

## Working relationship with the external auditor

During the year, the committee met with the external auditor without management present to provide additional opportunity for open dialogue and feedback between both parties. Matters typically discussed include the external auditor's assessment of business risks, the transparency and openness of interactions with management, confirmation that there has been no restriction in scope placed on the auditor by management, the independence of their audit and how they have exercised professional scepticism. I also meet with the external lead audit partner ahead of each committee meeting. Additionally, the director of audit, risk and compliance liaises with, and meets, the external auditors on a regular basis, and the external auditors receive a copy of each internal audit report.

## Non-audit services and independence

Ernst &amp; Young LLP provided non-audit services to the group during the year ended 31 December 2024. These services related only to the interim review. Total non-audit service fees amounted to £0.1 million (2023: £0.1 million), less than 50% of the audit fees. All non-audit fees are approved by the committee.

Ernst &amp; Young LLP confirmed to the committee its independence, taking into account any threats to independence including fees from non-audit services.

## Clinical governance and safety committee (CGSC)

To ensure that the committee and the CGSC complement each other's work, Dame Janet Husband and I have followed these important protocols:

- At each meeting this committee receives a report from Dame Janet Husband focused on risk and material control matters discussed at the CGSC
- We split the focus of risk management with the CGSC focusing on the clinical risk management at corporate and hospital level and this committee on the principal risks, and non-clinical operational risks, of the group

## Data strategy, governance and security committee (DSGS)

In 2023, the executive committee set up the new DSGS committee to improve the governance and oversight of data management in a rapidly evolving environment of new technologies and cyber-security risks. The chair of the DSGS committee, the general counsel, has a reporting line into this committee and provides a report at each meeting.

## Our priorities for 2025

The committee's focus in 2025 will remain largely consistent with 2024 ie:

- Implementation of digital change programmes
- Monitoring the organisation's readiness for the UK Corporate Governance Reforms
- Cyber security
- Implementation of sustainability financial reporting standards (assuming the UK government announces a firm timetable for their adoption during 2025)

## Role and responsibilities

The remuneration committee has authority from the board to determine the framework and total remuneration arrangements of the executive directors and, in consultation with the chief executive officer, senior management. It also oversees the group's share-based incentive arrangements. In practice, the committee agrees:

- Policy for cash remuneration, executive share plans, service contracts and termination arrangements
- Reward packages of the chairman, executive directors and the executive committee, including arrangements on appointment
- Termination arrangements for executive directors and the executive committee members
- Recommendations to the board concerning any new executive share plans or changes to existing schemes which require shareholders' approval
- Basis on which awards are granted and their amount to executive directors and senior management under the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)

The remuneration committee also ensures consistency of remuneration arrangements across all levels within Spire Healthcare. It also has responsibility for matters identified by the UK Corporate Governance Code relating to workforce engagement.

Remuneration committee report continued

## Dear shareholder,

I am pleased to present to you the directors' remuneration report for the year ended 31 December 2024.

Our renewed directors' remuneration policy was approved by 98.64% of shareholders at the AGM in May 2024 and I would like to thank shareholders for their engagement and support. I am confident that this policy continues to support the delivery of our strategic priorities and provides alignment with our culture and purpose. This letter provides further detail of the work of the committee and decisions taken in respect of 2024.

We welcomed Paula Bobbett who became a member of the committee in February 2024. We were saddened by the unexpected death of Martin Angle and will miss his valuable contributions and perspectives as a member of the committee.

## Performance in 2024

Spire Healthcare delivered financial performance in-line with guidance for 2024 with revenue growth of 11.2%, 6.2% on a comparable basis, and adjusted EBITDA of £260.0 million which is 11.1% up on 2023, 9% on a comparable basis. Our focus on enhancing margins has enabled us to deliver an increase in hospitals adjusted EBITDA margin, from 17.6% in 2023 to 18% in 2024. This is underpinned by the success of our savings and efficiency programmes, which generated more than £20 million.

Market fundamentals remain strong, with excellent performance from our NHS revenue, up 7.7%, 8.8% on a comparable basis and private revenue up 3.7%, 4.3% on a comparable basis. Our strategy is delivering, we are successfully managing both margin and growth through acuity mix, price, optimal capacity utilisation and delivery of cost savings. We have also reached record levels of permanent hospital staff and retention.

Primary care services have shown strong growth, primarily driven through Vita Health Group performing ahead of plan. We also opened three standalone clinics which are focused on outpatients, diagnostics and minor treatments, and drive referrals to nearby hospitals. We are pleased to play a role in the new NHS and independent sector partnership and continue in our strategic partnership with the NHS.

Maintaining strong quality and safety credentials remain core to our activities and our focus on continuous improvement has resulted in 98% of our inspected locations rated 'Good', 'Outstanding' or the equivalent by health inspectors in England, Scotland and Wales.

## Wider workforce pay

The committee has continued to monitor the impact of economic pressures on colleagues and fully supported the management proposal to make significant investment in salary increases through an increase to our minimum rates of pay, the annual salary review and implementation of our reward framework in all our hospitals. As a result of these investments, we are benefiting from increasing retention and fewer vacancies.

The majority of our permanent colleagues received a 2.75% salary increase with additional investment made to our minimum rates of pay. We launched our reward framework for our permanent colleagues in all our hospitals and a few other business areas in December 2024. The framework provides a consistent view of our roles with improved competitiveness, particularly for key roles where we have difficulty attracting and retaining talent.

The committee has received regular updates and held deep dive sessions on the reward framework, which has been developed with extensive engagement and input from the business. The reward framework is an important step in our commitment to invest in and support our people and provide structure and clarity for our roles.

## 2024 salary and incentive outcomes

In line with the majority of the workforce, the annual salary review of 2.75% was applied to the chief executive officer in September 2024. There was no increase applied to the new or former chief financial officer during 2024.

The bonus is linked to adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and individual strategic objectives. The financial and operating performance in the year resulted in bonuses being earned in respect of 2024 with a solid performance against stretching targets. The committee also evaluated the performance of the executive directors against a number of individual strategic objectives. This resulted in an overall bonus outcome for Justin Ash of 36.1% of maximum. Notwithstanding the significant increase in EBITDA year-on-year, the bonus outcome is lower than last year, reflecting the highly stretching nature of the targets set at the start of the year.

The 2022 LTIP awards were based on total shareholder return (TSR), financial and operational excellence performance measured to 31 December 2024. During the performance period, the company delivered growth in shareholder value which was between median and upper quartile against the FTSE 250 (excluding investment trusts) comparator group over the equivalent period. Return on capital employed exceeded the target with the outcome of this element at 8.2%. For operational excellence, the regulatory rating objective was met in full and the outcome for engagement was within the target range.

The overall vesting outcome for this award was 60.8% of maximum. Vested awards for executive directors at the time of award will be subject to a further two-year holding period.

The committee reviewed the incentive outcomes against wider company and individual performance, the shareholder experience and the wider stakeholder experience. The committee determined that the outcomes are fair and appropriate in this context.

## Chief financial officer transition

As set out in the 2023 directors' remuneration report, Harbant Samra was appointed as chief financial officer at the May 2024 AGM, at which point Jitesh Sodha stepped down from the board. Details of the remuneration arrangements were set out in full in the 2023 directors' remuneration report.

## Remuneration for 2025

Salary increases normally take effect from September. Any increase to salaries for the chief executive officer will take into account the average increase awarded to the wider workforce. As set out in the 2023 directors' remuneration report, Harbant's base salary on appointment was set at £380,000, which was below the salary of his predecessor (£432,600). In line with best practice, the committee intended to keep Harbant's base salary under review to reflect his experience and development in role. Taking into account his strong performance, leadership and development in the role since appointment, Harbant's salary will be increased to £405,000 with effect from 1 May 2025, being one year since his appointment to the role. It is currently expected that Harbant will not be eligible for a salary increase in September.

Incentives are based on financial, operational and strategic elements. The maximum bonus opportunity for executive directors remains unchanged at 150% of salary. During the year, the committee reviewed the bonus structure across the group to ensure that it is fit-for-purpose and appropriately rewards employees for group performance. Following this review, there will be a simplification of the structure for 2025, with a greater focus on group EBITDA performance for all bonus participants. For executive directors, the total bonus outcome will be linked to the achievement of adjusted group EBITDA with up to 30% of the final bonus outcome assessed against strategic objectives.

For LTIP grants to executive directors, it is expected that awards equivalent to 200% of salary will be granted, in line with last year. The committee considered removing relative TSR from the LTIP for 2025 given the lack of direct, relevant, listed peers and the concentrated nature of our shareholder base. There are a range of views amongst our larger investors on this metric; therefore, on balance, the metric has been retained for 2025 with a weighting of 20%. The committee will keep this under review for grants in future years. We expect EBIT margin to be more prominent and relevant than EBITDA margin by the end of the performance period in 2027, as outlined at the Capital Markets Day in April 2024. Accordingly, hospital business margin will be assessed based on EBIT with a weighting of 15%. The operational excellence measures, with a combined weighting of 30%, continue to be an important focus. The ROCE measure is unchanged with a weighting of 35%.

## Remuneration principles - how our approach to pay reflects the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code

| Clarity              | Incentive arrangements are intended to be closely aligned to our strategy to effectively engage with participants. The remuneration committee regularly engages with wider stakeholders including shareholders and seeks to provide clear disclosure and explanation of our pay arrangements.                              |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Simplicity           | Our remuneration policies are straightforward and easy to understand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Risk                 | Our variable incentive schemes contain an appropriate balance of financial and non-financial measures so that risk is effectively managed and mitigated. Discretion, malus and clawback help to prevent payments for failure.                                                                                              |
| Predictability       | Potential values from remuneration arrangements are clearly communicated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Proportionality      | Incentives incorporate performance measures that are linked to the strategic goals of the business. Variable pay is intended to reward for successful execution of the strategy over the short and longer term. The remuneration committee is also mindful of the outcomes of variable incentives for the wider workforce. |
| Alignment to culture | Targets for variable incentives are intended to be based on a balance of measures to provide a rounded assessment of performance. Weare conscious of our impact on wider stakeholders and howthat ultimately impacts the value wecreate for shareholders.                                                                  |

Other information

- 2025 LTIP awards will be based on the following measures: ROCE (35%), EBIT margin (hospital) (15%), relative TSR (20%), engagement (15%) and regulatory ratings (15%).
- Performance will be measured over a three-year period from 1 January 2025 to 31 December 2027.
1.    Straight-line vesting between points shown.
2.    Return on Capital Employed is calculated as 'Adjusted EBIT/Capital Employed'. Capital Employed is calculated as 'Total Assets less Cash less Current Liabilities less Capital expenditure in the previous 12 months'. Capital expenditure in the last 12 months reflects additions of fixed assets (excluding leased assets). Return on Capital Employed will be measured as at 31 December 2027.
3.    Vesting for the regulatory rating element can be scaled back (including to nil) if any site is rated 'inadequate'. The remuneration committee is satisfied that outcomes at the upper-end of the scale would represent exceptional and market leading results for the portfolio, especially in the context of continued enhancements in the expectations of our regulators.
4.    We are currently undertaking a review of the provider and methodology for engagement and targets will be disclosed in full in the 2025 directors' remuneration report.
- LTIP awards are subject to a two-year, post vesting holding period
- 200% of salary in-employment shareholding guideline
- Post-cessation shareholding requirements apply at the same level as the in-employment guideline (or actual shareholding, if lower) for two years following cessation of employment
- Malus and/or clawback provisions apply to annual bonus awards and LTIP awards

For the 2024 financial year, the maximum bonus opportunity for executive directors was 150% of base salary. Awards for current executive directors were measured 60% on adjusted EBITDA, 20% on free cash flow and 20% against individual strategic objectives.

All bonuses in the group, including those payable to executive directors, were subject to a minimum EBITDA trigger of £238.0 million and a minimum quality trigger. Both hurdles were achieved for 2024, and therefore executive directors were considered for bonuses. A portion of bonuses for Justin Ash and Harbant Samra are deferred into shares for three years.

Financial measure targets and outcomes for 2024 were as follows:

Based on the assessment above, the overall outcome is 36.1% of the maximum bonus for the chief executive officer and 35.4% for Harbant Samra for his time as the chief financial officer.

Taking into account overall performance during the year and strategic progress made, the remuneration committee is satisfied that the outcomes are appropriate and no discretion has been applied.

As disclosed last year, as a good leaver, Jitesh Sodha was eligible to participate in the annual bonus scheme to the extent that he worked his notice period. For the period that he was an executive director, he was eligible for a bonus of up to 150% of salary, pro-rated for time up to the date he stepped down from the board. As he was only on the board until 8 May 2024, his bonus was based on 50% group objectives (75% adjusted group EBITDA and 25% group free cash flow) and 50% based on individual strategic objectives. The EBITDA and free cash flow outcomes are the same as applied to the current executive directors. His individual objectives related to overseeing the integration of Vita Health Group and the next stage of profitability enhancement for the Doctors Clinic Group, delivering the 2023 full-year results and annual report, and a comprehensive

1.  There is no vesting for performance below these levels.

2.  There is straight-line vesting between the points shown.

3.    To ensure a more rounded assessment over the LTIP performance period, the employee engagement score has been measured using a three-year average over the performance period.

Overall, the committee is satisfied that the outcomes from this award are supported by improvements in underlying performance over the period and the experience of our shareholders. Therefore, the committee is satisfied that the vesting outcomes are fully warranted.

Awards under the LTIP were granted to Justin Ash and Harbant Samra on 14 March 2024. No award was granted to Jitesh Sodha. These awards were granted in the form of nil-cost options over Spire Healthcare Group plc shares, with the number of shares that may vest conditional on performance over the three-year period to 31 December 2026. The maximum award granted to executive directors was equivalent to 200% of base salary.

## CEO pay ratio for 2024

The table below shows the ratio of the total remuneration of the chief executive officer to that of the lower quartile, median and upper quartile employees and bank workers in 2024, consistent with the regulations.

|   Year | Method   |           | P25 (LQ)   | P50 (Median)   | P75 (UQ)   |
|--------|----------|-----------|------------|----------------|------------|

Spire Healthcare has compared the total remuneration of the chief executive officer to UK employees for the 12 months ending 31 December 2024 on a full-time equivalent basis. The company has determined the P25, P50 and P75 individuals with reference to a ranking of total remuneration.

The company's principles for pay setting and progression in our wider workforce are the same as for our executives which form a total reward proposition which is competitive to attract and retain the highest quality of talent in a difficult market, while providing opportunities for development and career progression.

The median pay ratio reported is consistent with the wider policies in place at Spire Healthcare. All employees are eligible for pay increases, recognition awards, participation in Sharesave, and career and development opportunities.

The pay for the chief executive officer is, by design, intended to have a larger proportion linked to performance-based variable pay, and therefore the pay ratio would be expected to vary year-on-year and be higher in years when the business performs well. The CEO pay ratio is lower in 2024 due to lower variable pay. There is no discernible trend between the period from 2019 to 2024. For colleagues, the year-on-year change in remuneration reflects the application of annual salary review of 2.75% for majority of permanent colleagues and investment in the reward framework for hospitals.

## Notes to the calculation

- The 2024, total remuneration for the colleagues identified at P25, P50 and P75 are as follows: £26,785, £34,833, £49,062
- The 2024, base salary for the colleagues identified at P25, P50 and P75 are as follows: £24,180, £32,866, £42,385
- Under option A, the ratios are based on the full-time equivalent total remuneration which includes base salary, incentive payments, taxable benefits and pension benefits for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2024
- Option A is selected as it is considered to provide the most transparent approach to calculation
- Vita Health Group is included in the 2024 calculation
- The reference colleagues at the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile have been determined by reference to the last day of the financial year, 31 December 2024
- In accordance with the regulations, employees and bank workers have been included, while non-executive directors, contractors and medical consultants have not been included
- A total of 15,281 employees and bank workers were included in the calculation of the CEO Pay ratio. Colleagues on reduced pay due to long-term sickness absence, maternity leave or with zero pay in 2024 were excluded from the calculation
- Pay for each colleague is calculated in accordance with the single figure of remuneration. All components of remuneration are presented on a full-time equivalent basis by dividing sums by the number of hours for the portion of the year worked, and subsequently multiplying by the relevant annual full-time hours
- Bank workers do not participate in the annual bonus plan, Long-Term Incentive Plan and do not have any taxable benefits
- A significant portion of the chief executive officer's pay is variable. The pay ratio is, therefore, significantly impacted by the outcomes of variable pay plans
- The full amount of the annual bonus for the chief executive officer for 2024 is included in the total remuneration figure, including the portion deferred into shares

Annual report on remuneration continued

## Departure terms for Jitesh Sodha

As fully disclosed in the 2023 directors' remuneration report and set out here again for completeness, Jitesh Sodha stepped down from the board and his role as chief financial officer upon conclusion of the 2024 annual general meeting. After stepping down from the board, Jitesh initially supported his successor with transition before focusing on a number of strategic initiatives for the remainder of his 12-month notice period. While Jitesh remains an employee, he will continue to receive his base salary and benefits. Healthcare benefits will cease 12 months after the end of his notice period. As Jitesh will continue to work his notice period, he will not receive any payment in lieu of notice or any other termination payment. He will also be provided with professional fees in relation to legal and career transition support of up to £55,000.

In light of Jitesh's performance and contribution during his tenure, he was treated as a 'good leaver' for incentive plan purposes. Outstanding deferred bonus awards and LTIP awards subject to a holding period will be released at the normal time. LTIP awards that are unvested at cessation of employment will be pro-rated for time and will remain subject to performance assessed at the end of the relevant performance period. Jitesh was not granted a further LTIP award in respect of 2024. Details of the 2024 bonus earned while on the board are included in the single figure table.

The post-employment shareholding requirement as set out in the annual report on remuneration will apply for a period of two years from the date he stepped down from the board.

## Advice provided to the remuneration committee

During the course of the year, Deloitte LLP provided external advice to the remuneration committee and its total fees were £94,000 (2023: £84,800). During 2024, Deloitte LLP also provided other consulting services to the group. Deloitte LLP has voluntarily signed up to the remuneration consultants' code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting during the year. The remuneration committee is comfortable that the Deloitte LLP engagement partner and team that provides remuneration advice to the remuneration committee do not have connections with the company or any of its directors that may impair their independence.

The non-executive chairman, chief executive officer, chief financial officer, group people director and company secretary attended committee meetings by invitation in order to provide the remuneration committee with additional context. No individual participates in decisions regarding their own remuneration.

Shareholders will also be asked to authorise the directors to hold general meetings at 14 clear days' notice (where this flexibility is merited by the business of the meeting and is thought to be in the interests of shareholders as a whole). Further items of business to be proposed at the annual general meeting are described throughout this directors' report.

## Dividends

The directors recommend the payment of a final dividend in respect of the year ended 31 December 2024 of 2.3 pence per ordinary share (2023: 2.1 pence per share).

As a result of Sir David's appointment with AXA UK and Ireland, the Company does not consider him to be independent.

A list of the current directors of Spire Healthcare Group plc can be found on pages 97 to 99.

The UK Corporate Governance Code provides for all directors of FTSE companies to stand for re-election by shareholders every year. Accordingly, all members of the board, with the exception of Dame Janet Husband who will step down as a director, will retire and seek re-election at this year's annual general meeting. Full biographical details of all of the directors can be found on pages 98 and 99.

Further information on the contractual arrangements of the executive directors is given on pages 114. The non-executive directors do not have service agreements.

## Powers of the directors

The business of the company is managed by the directors who may exercise all the powers of the company, subject to any relevant legislation, any directions given by the company by passing a special resolution and to the company's articles of association. The articles, for example, contain specific provisions concerning the company's power to borrow money and issue shares.

## Appointment and removal of directors

Rules relating to the appointment and removal of the directors are contained within the company's articles of association.

## Director's indemnities

See page 94 in the corporate governance section.

## Amendment of articles of association

The company may only make amendments to the articles of association of the company by way of special resolution of the shareholders, in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.

## Employees

The group is an equal opportunities employer and is committed to creating an environment which will attract, retain and motivate its people, by creating a working environment in which individuals are able to make best use of their skills, free from discrimination or harassment, and in which all decisions are based on merit. Spire Healthcare employs people who consider themselves to have a disability (a physical or mental impairment which has a substantial and long-term adverse effect on their ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities).

Employees who consider themselves to have a disability are under no obligation to inform their employer of this, however, we are fully aware of, and comply with, our obligations in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Equality Act 2010.

We remain committed to colleague involvement throughout the business. Colleagues are kept well informed of the clinical and financial performance of the facility that they work in as well as the group more widely. Examples of colleague involvement and engagement are highlighted throughout this annual report. When appropriate, consultations with employee and union representatives take place. The group gives full and fair consideration to applications for employment from disabled persons. Should an employee become disabled during their employment with Spire Healthcare, every effort is made to enable them to continue their service with the group.

Further information on our colleagues can be found under strategy from page 21 and engagement with stakeholders from page 55.

Strategic report

## Statement regarding fostering relationships with suppliers, customers and others

Explanation of how the directors have fostered the company's business relationships with suppliers, customers, employees and others, and taken each group into account when making principal decisions can be found under engagement with stakeholders from page 55.

## Political donations and expenditure

The group made no political donations during the year. Although the company does not make, and does not intend to make, donations to political parties, within the normal meaning of that expression, the definition of political donations under the Companies Act 2006 is very broad and includes expenses legitimately incurred as part of the process of talking to members of parliament and opinion formers to ensure that the issues and concerns of the group are considered and addressed. These activities are not intended to support any political party and the group's policy is not to make any donations for political purposes in the normally accepted sense.

A resolution will therefore be proposed at the annual general meeting seeking shareholder approval for the directors to be given authority to make donations and incur expenditure which might otherwise be caught by the terms of the Companies Act 2006. The authority sought will be limited to a maximum amount of £100,000.

## Share capital

As at the date of this report, Spire Healthcare Group plc had an issued share capital of 402,759,599 ordinary shares of 1 pence each, being the total number of shares with voting rights.

Equiniti Trust (Jersey) Limited, as trustee of the company's Employee Benefit Trust, holds 388,184 ordinary shares of 1 pence each (2023: 312,160). Further details can be found in note 22 on page 155.

The rights attaching to the shares are set out in the articles of association. There are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares in the capital of the company other than those which may be imposed by law from time-to-time. There are no special control rights in relation to the company's shares and the company is not aware of any agreements between holders of securities that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights. In accordance with the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules, certain employees are required to seek approval prior to dealing in the company's shares. The company's entire issued ordinary share capital is listed on the premium segment of the Official List of the Financial Conduct Authority and to unconditional trading on the London Stock Exchange plc's main market for listed securities.

Further information relating to the company's issued share capital can be found in note 22 to the company's financial statements on page 155.

The company announced in October 2024 a return of up to £5 million of cash to its shareholders through the means of an on-market share buyback programme. The sole purpose of the programme was to reduce the issued share capital of the Company, delivering further value for shareholders, and any ordinary shares purchased under the programme will be cancelled. A total of 1,388,749 shares were purchased under the buyback programme by the year-end. No shares were acquired by forfeiture or surrender or made subject to a lien or charge. Details of the shares purchased by the company's Employee Benefit Trust are shown in note 22 on page 155.

## Allot shares and pre-emption rights

Shareholders will be asked to renew both the general authority of the directors to issue shares and to authorise the directors to issue shares without applying the statutory pre-emption rights. In this regard, the company will continue to adhere to the provisions in the pre-emption group's Statement of Principles.

Further details on these matters can be found in the 2025 notice of annual general meeting.

## Voting rights

In a general meeting of the company, on a show of hands, every member who is present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote. On a poll, every member who is present in person or by proxy shall have one vote for every share of which they are the holder.

## Restrictions on voting

Unless the directors otherwise determine, a shareholder shall not be entitled to vote either personally or by proxy:

- If any call or other sum presently payable to the company in respect of that share remains unpaid or
- Having been duly served with a notice to provide the company with information under Section 793 of the Companies Act 2006, and has failed to do so within 14 days, for so long as the default continues

## Directors' interests in shares

During the year, no director had any material interest in any contract of significance to the group's business.

- There are a number of contracts which allow the counterparties to alter or terminate those arrangements in the event of a change of control of the company. These arrangements are commercially sensitive and confidential and their disclosure could be seriously prejudicial to the group
- The company's share incentive plans contain provisions relating to a change of control and full details of these plans are provided in the directors' remuneration report on pages 111 to 122. Outstanding options and awards would normally vest and become exercisable on a change of control, subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions, if applicable, at that time

The relationship agreement entered into with Mediclinic Jersey Limited (formerly called Remgro Jersey Limited), a subsidiary of Mediclinic International PLC, in June 2015 is deemed a material agreement between the company and its principal shareholder. The agreement does not include a change of control provision but does terminate upon the earlier of the company's ordinary shares ceasing to be listed and traded on the London Stock Exchange's main market for listed securities and the principal shareholder ceasing to be entitled, in aggregate, to exercise or to control the exercise of 15% or more of the votes to be cast on all or substantially all matters of a general meeting of the company.

## Compensation for loss of office

There are no agreements between the group and its directors or employees providing for compensation for loss of office or employment that occurs as a result of a change of control.

## Disclosures required under UK listing rule 6.6.1R

The table below is included to meet the requirements of UK Listing Rule section 6.6.1R. The information required to be disclosed by that section, where applicable to the company, can be located in the annual report 2024 at the references set out above.

## Financial risk

The group's disclosure regarding financial risk is disclosed in note 33 on page 162 of the financial statements.

## Events after the reporting period

On 21 February 2025 Brighton Orthopaedic and Sports Injury Clinic Limited formally notified Spire Healthcare of the intention to exercise their put option for Spire Healthcare to purchase the remaining 25% interest in Montefiore House Limited. A financial liability of £8.0 million is provided for this purchase, refer to note 24 on page 157.

## Going concern

The group assessed going concern risk for the period through to 30 June 2026. As at 31 December 2024 the group had cash of £41.2 million and borrowings of £365 million of which £325 million is a Senior Loan Facility and £40 million drawn Revolving Credit Facility (RCF). The Group has access to an undrawn Revolving Credit Facility of £60 million. On 3 March 2023, the group exercised the option to extend the senior loan facility and RCF by a further year to February 2027. The financial covenants relating to this agreement are materially unchanged and there have been no modifications to the agreement terms.

The group has undertaken extensive activity to identify plausible risks which may arise and mitigating actions, which in the first instance would include management of working capital and constrained levels of capital investment. Based on the current assessment of the likelihood of these risks arising by 30 June 2026, together with their assessment of the planned mitigating actions being successful, the directors have concluded it is appropriate to prepare the accounts on a going concern basis. In arriving at their conclusion, the directors have also noted that, were these risks to arise in combination, it could result in a liquidity constraint or breach of covenant. However, the risk of this is considered remote.

The group has also assessed, as part of its reverse stress testing, what degree of downturn in trading it could sustain before it breaches its financial covenant. This stress testing was based on flexing revenue downwards with a consistent percentage decline in variable costs, whilst maintaining the forecast of fixed costs. The testing allows for the benefit of mitigating actions that could be taken by management to preserve cash. This testing suggested that there would have to be at least a 30% fall in annual forecast revenue before the group breaches its financial covenant, we believe that the risk of an event giving rise to this size of reduction in revenue is remote.

It should be noted that we remain in a period of material geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty. Whilst the directors continue to closely monitor these risks and their plausible impact, their severity is hard to predict and is dependent upon many external factors. Accordingly, the actual financial impact of these risks may materially vary against the current view of their plausible impact.

## Disclosure of information to auditor

Having made enquiries of fellow directors and of the company's auditor, each of the directors confirms that:

- To the best of their knowledge and belief, there is no relevant audit information of which the company's auditor is unaware
- They have taken all the steps a director might reasonably be expected to have taken to be aware of relevant audit information and to establish that the company's auditor is aware of that information

## Reappointment of auditor

Resolutions for the reappointment of Ernst &amp; Young LLP as the auditor of the company and to authorise the directors to determine its remuneration will be proposed at the annual general meeting. Ernst &amp; Young LLP has expressed its willingness to be reappointed.

## Statement of directors' responsibilities

The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the group's financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and regulations.

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have elected to prepare the group and parent company financial statements in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standards ('UK-adopted IFRS') as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ('IASB') and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. Under company law the directors must not approve the group's financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and the company and of the profit or loss of the group and the company for that period.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the company's and group's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and the group and enable them to ensure that the company and the group financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the group and parent company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

In preparing these financial statements the directors are required to:

- Select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8 accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors and then apply them consistently
- Make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent
- Present information in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information
- Provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the group and company financial position and financial performance
- In respect of the group financial statements, state whether UK-adopted International Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements
- In respect of the parent company financial statements, state whether UK-adopted International Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements
- Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is appropriate to presume that the company and/or the group will not continue in business

Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a strategic report, directors' report, directors' remuneration report and corporate governance statement that comply with that law and those regulations. The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the company's website.

Each of the directors confirms that, to the best of their knowledge:

- That the consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with UK-adopted International Accounting Standards give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the parent company and undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole
- That the annual report, including the strategic report, includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the company and undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face
- That they consider the annual report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the company's position, performance, business model and strategy

By order of the board.

## Opinion

In our opinion:

- Spire Healthcare Group plc's group financial statements and parent company financial statements (the 'financial statements') give a true and fair view of the state of the group's and of the parent company's affairs as at 31 December 2024 and of the group's profit for the year then ended
- the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards
- the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards as applied in accordance with section 408 of the Companies Act 2006; and
- the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006

We have audited the financial statements of Spire Healthcare Group plc (the 'parent company') and its subsidiaries (the 'group') for the year ended 31 December 2024 which comprise:

| Group                                                                                                | Parent company                                                                                         |

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and UK adopted international accounting standards and as regards the parent company financial statements, as applied in accordance with section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.

## Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion

## Independence

We are independent of the group and parent in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC's Ethical Standard were not provided to the group or the parent company and we remain independent of the group and the parent company in conducting the audit.

## Conclusions relating to going concern

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the directors' assessment of the group and parent company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:

- The audit engagement partner and senior team members directed and supervised the audit procedures on going concern, in particular assessing the going concern models, assumptions therein and the result of stress testing scenarios.
- In conjunction with our walkthrough of the group's financial close process, we confirmed our understanding of management's going concern assessment process and also engaged with management early to ensure all key factors were considered in its assessment;
- In obtaining an understanding of management's rationale for the use of the going concern basis of accounting we have challenged the completeness of the assessment by ensuring that management had considered all principal risks as well as emerging issues within the assessments;

## Managements' assessment and assumptions

- We obtained management's board approved forecast cash flows and covenant calculations covering the period of assessment from the financial statement approval date to 30 June 2026. We checked the models for arithmetical accuracy and considered the group's historical forecasting accuracy;
- We evaluated the appropriateness of the duration of the going concern assessment period to 30 June 2026 and considered the existence of any significant events or conditions beyond this period based on our enquiries of management, the group's five-year plan and knowledge arising from other areas of the audit;
- We assessed the reasonableness of the cashflow forecast by analysis of management's historical forecasting accuracy and understanding how any anticipated impact of inflation on consumer spending and shortage in healthcare professionals have been modelled.
- We evaluated the relevance and reliability of the underlying data used to make the assessment through considering corroborating evidence from external sources. We read analyst reports to identify potentially contradictory evidence on future profitability to challenge the going concern assessment. We ensured that climate change considerations were factored into future cash flows.

## Debt covenants

- We obtained all the group's borrowing facility agreements and performed a detailed examination of these agreements. We assessed their continued availability to the group throughout the going concern period and ensured the completeness of covenants identified by management.
- We extended our procedures (including inquiries of management, considering the maturity of debt/ availability of access to future financing in the viability period) to consider events beyond 30 June 2026. We have also inquired with our internal debt advisory specialists over the availability and prospects of Spire's refinancing options based on the corporate finance market for the sector, noting the maturity of facilities due to expire after the going concern period in February 2027.
- We evaluated the compliance of the group with debt covenants in the forecast period by reperforming calculations of the covenant tests. We further assessed the impact of the downside risk scenarios on covenant compliance and applied sensitivity analysis.

Annual Report and Accounts 204

Independent auditor's report continued

Stress testing and evaluation of management's plans for future actions

- We performed an independent reverse stress test to understand what it would take to breach available liquidity and exhaust covenant headroom.
- We considered management's plausible downside risk scenarios of the group's cash flow forecast models and their impact on forecast liquidity and banking covenants, specifically whether the downside risks were reasonably possible. We considered the adverse effects that could arise from these risks individually and also selected risks in combination.
- We considered the likelihood of management's ability to execute feasible mitigating actions available to respond to the downside risk scenarios based on our understanding of the group and the sector, including considering whether those mitigating actions were controllable by management.

## Disclosures

- We considered whether management's disclosures within the annual report and accounts, sufficiently and appropriately capture the impacts of the group's principal risks on the going concern assessment and through consideration of relevant disclosure standards.

## Our key observations were:

- The directors' assessment forecasts that the group will remain compliant with its debt covenants and maintain sufficient liquidity throughout the Going Concern assessment period.
- Stress testing performed indicated a 30% downturn in revenue, after taking into consideration controllable mitigating actions, is required for the group to breach its debt covenants. Management considers such a scenario is not plausible, however, in such an event management considers that the controllable mitigating actions would include management of working capital and constrained levels of capital investment. The group's principal source of funding extends beyond the going concern period to 2027. No loan repayments are due in the going concern period.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group and parent company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period to 30 June 2026.

In relation to the group and parent company's reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the group's ability to continue as a going concern.

## An overview of the scope of the parent company and group audits Tailoring the scope

In the current year our audit scoping has been updated to reflect the new requirements of ISA (UK) 600 (Revised). We have followed a risk-based approach when developing our audit approach to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence on which to base our audit opinion. We performed risk assessment procedures, with input from our component auditors, to identify and assess risks of material misstatement of the group financial statements and identified significant accounts and disclosures. When identifying components at which audit work needed to be performed to respond to the identified risks of material misstatement of the group financial statements, we considered our understanding of the group and its business environment, the potential impact of climate change, the applicable financial framework, the group's system of internal control at the entity level, the existence of centralised processes, applications and any relevant internal audit results.

We determined that centralised audit procedures would be performed on goodwill, right-of-use assets, lease liabilities, financial asset, investment in subsidiaries, intercompany, cash and cash equivalents, revenue, taxation and equity.

We then identified two components as individually relevant to the group due to materiality or financial size of the component relative to the group. These were the hospitals operating segment and the head office corporate entity. We then identified an additional thirteen components as individually relevant to the group based on the materiality of specific accounts relative to the group or due to the presence of significant events and conditions underlying the identified risks of material misstatement of the group's financial statements. These comprised a number of the group's key operating businesses across the primary care segment and hospitals segment.

We then considered whether the remaining group significant account balances not yet subject to audit procedures, in aggregate, could give rise to a risk of material misstatement of the group financial statements. We selected nine further components of the group to include in our audit scope to address these risks which consisted of holding companies.

Of the eleven components within the scope of audit, we designed and performed audit procedures on the entire financial information of two components ('full scope component'). For nine components, we designed and performed audit procedures on specific significant financial statement account balances or disclosures of the financial information of the component ('specific scope components').

Our scoping to address the risk of material misstatement for each key audit matter is set out in the key audit matters section of our report.

## Involvement with component teams

All audit work performed for the purposes of the audit was undertaken by the group audit team.

## Climate change

Stakeholders are increasingly interested in how climate change will impact the group. The group has determined that the most significant future impacts from climate change on its operations will be from severe and extreme weather patterns, potential changes to laws and regulations, fluctuation in energy prices, and increased costs as a result of measures to reduce carbon emissions. These are explained on pages 77 to 82 in the required Task Force for Climate related Financial Disclosures and on page 70 in the principal risks and uncertainties. They have also explained their climate commitments within the sustainability report on pages 38 to 54. All of these disclosures form part of the 'Other information,' rather than the audited financial statements. Our procedures on these unaudited disclosures therefore consisted solely of considering whether they are materially inconsistent with the financial statements, or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appear to be materially misstated, in line with our responsibilities on 'Other information'.

In planning and performing our audit we assessed the potential impacts of climate change on the group's business and any consequential material impact on its financial statements.

As explained in the group's accounting policies and basis of preparation, the board has not identified any climate related risks or opportunities that would have a material impact on the assets or liabilities of the group. In notes 2, 14 and 15 to the financial statements, significant judgements and estimates relating to climate change have been described on the impairment assessment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets in addition to financial assets and liabilities.

Our audit effort in considering climate change was focused on evaluating management's assessment of the impact of climate risk. Additionally, we also assessed the costs of energy being appropriately reflected in the assessment of the carrying value of assets, impairment of assets, reduction of economic useful lives of tangible and intangible assets and associated disclosures where values are determined through modelling future cash flows, being the impairment tests of tangible and intangible assets and related disclosures.

We also challenged the directors' considerations of climate change risks in their assessment of going concern and viability and associated disclosures.

Based on our work we have not identified the impact of climate change on the financial statements to be a key audit matter or to impact a key audit matter.

## Key audit matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Risk

## Risk of impairment to intangible and tangible assets

Refer to the Audit Committee Report (page 108); Accounting policies (page 144); and Note 14 and 15 of the Consolidated Financial Statements (page 149 to 151)

At 31 December 2024 the carrying value of intangible and tangible assets was £1,663.4 million (2023: £1,618.8 million) including hospital properties' right of use assets of £642.4 million (2023: £633.6 million) and goodwill of £611.6 million (2023: £611.1 million).

The UK economic environment continues to be challenged by factors including high inflation levels, higher interest rates, and supply chain disruptions, specifically in the healthcare industry where capacity constraints are being faced, combined with continued pressure on higher wages.

No impairment has been recognised (2023: £0 million).

## Our response to the risk

We performed the following procedures:

- We gained an understanding of the process management has in place for impairment assessments through a walkthrough.
- We validated that the methodology of the impairment exercise is consistent with the requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, including appropriate identification of cash generating units for value in use calculations, by assessing the methodology against the requirements of IAS 36.
- We also confirmed the mathematical accuracy of the models.
- We obtained management's forecasts underlying the impairment assessment incorporating the continued impact from the macro-economic environment and climate related matters. We agreed them to forecasts approved by the board.
- We compared the forecasts to external sources such as industry analyst reports to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions applied as well to identify any contrary evidence to assist the audit team in determining the impact of this contrary evidence.
- We challenged management's historical accuracy of forecasting through comparing the budgets to actual results from 2021 to 2024 to determine whether forecast cash flows were reliable based on past experiences.
- We performed sensitivity analysis by testing key assumptions in the model to recalculate a range of potential outcomes in relation to the size of the headroom between the carrying value and the value in use. The sensitivities performed were based on the key assumptions underpinning managements' assessment.
- We have checked that the reasonable possible change assumptions applied by management are reasonable, complete and have been correctly calculated and disclosed.
- In addition, we worked with our EY internal valuation specialists to:
- Independently calculate the discount rate and compare this to the discount rate applied in the models by management. We sensitised management's calculation to use the discount rate independently calculated.
- We assessed the inputs applied by management for reasonableness by benchmarking them against peer companies and recent transactions.

## Disclosures

We evaluated the disclosures in the financial statements against the requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, in particular in, respect of the requirement to disclose sensitivities where a reasonably possible change in key assumptions could cause an impairment.

We performed full scope centralised audit procedures over this risk area.

Other information

## Key observations communicated to the audit committee

We concluded that the discount rate used by management was at the lower end of the appropriate range determined by EY internal valuation specialists. In addition, we concluded that key assumptions in relation to EBITDA growth for property, EBITDA margin growth for goodwill, capital maintenance expenditure, discount rates and long-term growth rates applied to the terminal values were reasonable.

We highlighted that a reasonably possible change in key assumptions including a change in EBITDA margin and the discount rate could lead to impairment charges to tangible assets. We also highlighted that a reasonably possible change in key assumptions including a change in EBITDA margin and the discount rate could lead to impairment charges to intangible assets.

| Revenue recognition: ManipulationofNHSrevenuethrough changes to the pricing master file Refer to the Audit Committee Report (page 108); Accounting policies (page 138 and 139); and Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements (page 145) NHSrevenue with the associated risk 2024: £367.5 million (2023: £341.1 million) The high volume of patient transactions, for which pricing is derived from the NHSnational tariff, leads to a higher likelihood of material misstatement through intentional changes to individual procedural pricing on the pricing master file. Weconsider the pressure to achieve forecast results or targets increases the risk of financial reporting manipulation by management. | Wehaveperformed the following procedures to gain assurance over NHSpricing: - Weuseddata analytics to assess the accuracy of all the FY24 NHSbilling data to publicly available NHSnational tariff base prices, adjusted by Market Force factors. - For any material portion of the revenue population for which wewere unable to agree the price billed to NHSnational tariff base prices, e.g. where the price was agreed locally for a specific procedure, wehave agreed a sample of this billing data to appropriate audit evidence. Specifically, wehave agreed a sample of this billing data to the underlying signed agreement or, in instances where no current contract or correspondence was available, wetraced the settlement of the invoice directly to cash. - Weuseddata analytics, covering all NHSrevenue transactions in the year, to test the correlation between revenue, accrued revenue, accounts receivable and cash. - Weinvestigated whether there were any pricing disputes with the NHSduring the year through discussions with legal counsel, review of minutes and the central concerns register. Weobtained a summary of aged NHSreceivables and verified that the ageing is appropriate by testing a sample across the different ageing categories. Wehaveperformed a search for any large or unusually long outstanding receivables that are outside expected credit terms which mayindicate that pricing disagreements exist. Whilst wehave not relied on any of the work performed by internal audit, wereviewed the results from their individual site audits completed during FY24, to understand if there were any revenue findings specific to NHSpricing which required further enquiry and/or corroboration. | Wedid not identify any material errors in the pricing master file, nor evidence of management manipulation of revenue through changes to the pricing master file. Wedid not identify any indicators of pricing disputes with the NHS. Based on our audit procedures performed, weconcluded that |

## Our application of materiality

We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in forming our audit opinion.

## Materiality

The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.

We determined materiality for the group to be £6.5 million (2023: £5.9 million), which is 2.6% of EBITDA (2023: 2.5% of Adjusted EBITDA). In prior years, our materiality calculation was based on adjusted EBITDA, we re-assessed our basis of materiality and concluded that EBITDA was more appropriate measure due to the relative size of adjusting items. We believe that EBITDA provides us with the most important metric to understand the financial performance of the business.

We determined materiality for the parent company to be £13.0 million (2023: £12.4 million), which is 1% (2023: 1%) of equity.

During the course of our audit, we reassessed initial materiality in line with actual EBITDA to reflect the reported performance of the group for the year.

## Performance materiality

The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.

On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the group's overall control environment, our judgement was that performance materiality was 50% (2023: 50%) of our planning materiality, namely £3.2 million (2023: £2.9 million). We have set performance materiality at this percentage due to our assessment of the control environment and the history of audit adjustments identified.

Overview

Strategic report

Governance report

Financial statements

Other information

Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is based on the relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component. In the current year, the range of performance materiality allocated to components was £0.7 million to £3.2 million (2023: £0.6 million to £2.9 million).

## Reporting threshold

An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of £0.3 million (2023: £0.3 million), which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.

We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.

## Other information

The other information comprises the information included in the annual report set out on pages 1 - 126 and pages 169 - 174, including the strategic report and the governance report, other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

## Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006

In our opinion, the part of the directors' remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

- the information given in the strategic report and the directors' report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
- the strategic report and the directors' report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

Independent auditor's report continued

## Matters on which we are required to report by exception

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors' report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:

- adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
- the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
- certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or
- we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit

## Corporate governance statement

We have reviewed the directors' statement in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the group and company's compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review by the UK Listing Rules.

Based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the Corporate Governance Statement is materially consistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the audit:

- Directors' statement with regards to the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting and any material uncertainties identified set out on page 125;
- Directors' explanation as to its assessment of the company's prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate set out on page 125;
- Directors' statement on whether it has a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue in operation and meets its liabilities set out on page 125;
- Directors' statement on fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 126
- Board's confirmation that it has carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks set out on page 65;
- The section of the annual report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems set out on page 67; and
- The section describing the work of the audit committee set out on page 105.

## Responsibilities of directors

As explained more fully in the directors' responsibilities statement set out on page 126, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group and parent company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.

Spire Healthcare Group plc

Annual Report and Accounts 204

Independent auditor's report continued

However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the company and management.

- We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the group and determined that the most significant are the Companies Act 2006, 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, the relevant tax compliance regulations in the UK and those administered by the Care Quality Commission in England and the equivalent organisation in Scotland and Wales. In addition, we concluded that there are certain significant laws and regulations which may have an effect on the determination of the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements being the Listing Rules of the London Stock Exchange, the UK Bribery Act 2010 and regulation relating to employment law and data protection.
- We understood how Spire Healthcare Group plc is complying with those frameworks by making enquiries of management, internal audit, those responsible for legal and compliance procedures and the company secretary. We corroborated our enquiries through our review of board minutes, papers provided to the Audit and Risk Committees and correspondence received from regulatory bodies.
- We assessed the susceptibility of the group's financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by meeting with management within various parts of the business to understand where they considered there was susceptibility to fraud. We also considered performance targets and their influence on efforts made by management to manage earnings or influence the perceptions of analysts. We considered the programmes and controls that the group has established to address the risk identified, or that otherwise prevent, deter and detect fraud; and how senior management monitors those programmes and controls. Where this risk was considered to be higher, we performed audit procedures to address each identified fraud risk. We have involved internal specialists as required in assessing compliance with relevant laws and regulations.
- Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations. Our procedures involved; review of board minutes to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations; reviewing external specialist reports, review of reporting to the Audit and Risk Committee on compliance with regulations; enquiries with legal counsel, group management and internal audit; testing of manual journals.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council's website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.

## Other matters we are required to address

- Following the recommendation from the audit committee, we were appointed by the company at its annual general meeting on 14 May 2020 to audit the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2020 and subsequent financial periods.
- The period of total uninterrupted engagement since the company's admission to the London Stock Exchange in 2014 is 10 years, covering the years ending 31 December 2014 to 31 December 2024.
- The audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the audit committee.

Overview

## Notes to financial statements

For the year ended 31 December 2024

## 1. General information

Spire Healthcare group plc (the 'company') and its subsidiaries (collectively, the 'group') owns and operates private hospitals and clinics in the UK and provides a range of private healthcare services.

The financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024 were authorised for issue by the board of directors of the company on 5 March 2025.

The company is a public limited company, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, incorporated, registered and domiciled in England and Wales (registered number: 09084066). The address of its registered office is 3 Dorset Rise, London, EC4Y 8EN.

## 2. Accounting policies

The material accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.

## Basis of preparation

The consolidated financial statements of the group have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted International Accounting Standards (UK-adopted IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments and financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value. The group financial statements are presented in UK sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest million pounds (£m), except when otherwise indicated.

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with UK-adopted IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the group's accounting policies. Further details on the group's critical judgements and estimates are included in Note 3.

The group has considered the future potential environmental impact on its current and future financial position and considered the impact to below.

## Going concern

The group assessed going concern risk for the period through to 30 June 2026. As at 31 December 2024 the group had cash of £41.2 million and borrowings of £365 million of which £325 million is a senior loan facility and £40 million drawn revolving credit facility (RCF). The group has access to an undrawn revolving credit facility of £60 million. On 3 March 2023, the group exercised the option to extend the senior loan facility and RCF by a further year to February 2027. The financial covenants relating to this agreement are materially unchanged and there have been no modifications to the agreement terms.

The group has undertaken extensive activity to identify plausible risks which may arise and mitigating actions, which in the first instance would include management of working capital and constrained levels of capital investment. Based on the current assessment of the likelihood of these risks arising by 30 June 2026, together with their assessment of the planned mitigating actions being successful, the directors have concluded it is appropriate to prepare the accounts on a going concern basis. In arriving at their conclusion, the directors have also noted that, were these risks to arise in combination, it could result in a liquidity constraint or breach of covenant. However, the risk of this is considered remote.

Other information

The group has also assessed, as part of its reverse stress testing, what degree of downturn in trading it could sustain before it breaches its financial covenant. This stress testing was based on flexing revenue downwards with a consistent percentage decline in variable costs, whilst maintaining the forecast of fixed costs. The testing allows for the benefit of mitigating actions that could be taken by management to preserve cash. This testing suggested that there would have to be at least a 30% fall in annual forecast revenue before the group breaches its financial covenant, we believe that the risk of an event giving rise to this size of reduction in revenue is remote.

It should be noted that we remain in a period of material geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty. Whilst the directors continue to closely monitor these risks and their plausible impact, their severity is hard to predict and is dependent upon many external factors. Accordingly, the actual financial impact of these risks may materially vary against the current view of their plausible impact.

Further detail on both macroeconomic-related risk is provided in the risk management and internal control section from page 65.

Other specific scenarios covered by our testing were as follows:

- The group is subject to temporary suspension of trade, with a temporary adverse impact on revenue, for example, as a result of a successful cyber-attack on key business systems
- The downside modelling of a number of risks which result in a decline in earnings, including the loss of a contractual relationship with a key insurer
- Significant change in government policy resulting in consultants going on payroll
- Short-term disruption to trade at a sub-set of hospitals owing to an extreme weather event

This review included the following key assumptions:

- No change in capital structure given the group has refinanced its existing senior finance facility and revolving credit facility in February 2022 and exercised the option to extend the senior facility for a further year; and
- The government will not make significant change to its existing policy towards utilising private provision of healthcare services to supplement the NHS

## Revenue recognition

The group derives its revenue primarily from providing private healthcare services to both the public sector and private patients in the UK. Revenue from charges to patients is recognised when the treatment is provided.

## Revenue from contracts with customers

The criteria for revenue recognition are as follows: identify the contract with the customer, identify the performance obligation, determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations, and satisfying the performance obligation. It applies to all contracts with customers, except those in the scope of other standards.

Revenue is recorded as services are transferred to the patient, with the consideration based on the total amount the group expects to receive, taking account of discounts where they are quantifiable and probable. Approximately 65% of the group's revenue is derived from inpatient and day case admissions. Revenue is recognised day-by-day, as services are provided to patients. These services are typically provided over a short time frame, that is, one to three days. Outpatient cases and other revenue represent approximately 35% of the group's revenue. Outpatient cases generally do not involve surgical procedures and revenue is recognised on an individual component basis when performance obligations are satisfied. Similarly, other revenue, which includes consultant revenue, and other third-party revenue streams, is recognised when performance

## 2. Accounting policies continued

## Revenue from contracts with customers continued

continued obligations are satisfied and the control of goods or services is transferred. Outpatient revenue for the primary care business includes rehabilitation, counselling and physiotherapy revenue. Revenue is either recognised over the period to which it relates or where there are multi-year contracts, the revenue is spread over the term of the contract. The majority of outpatient revenue received is under multi-year contracts with the NHS.

The group reports disaggregated revenue by material revenue stream (ie type of payor: PMI, NHS and self-pay) and other revenue which includes consultant revenue, third-party revenue streams (eg pathology services). Material revenue streams are consistent in nature, being the consideration received in return for the provision of healthcare services to patients. The timing and uncertainty of cash flows is similar for PMI and NHS business while self-pay revenue is received in advance or collected by credit card shortly after treatment. In addition, where possible and meaningful, Spire Healthcare reports revenue split between inpatient/day case, outpatient and other. As noted above, in all cases, revenue is recognised as performance obligations are completed in the form of services being provided to patients. Unbilled revenue is accrued at period ends. Invoices for the combination of services provided to patients are generally produced within three days of discharge.

## Interest income

Interest is recognised on an effective interest rate basis.

## Cost of sales

Cost of sales principally comprises salaries of clinical staff, consultant and clinical fees, medical services and inventories, including drugs, consumables and prostheses.

## Other operating costs

Other operating costs mainly comprise non-clinical staff costs, rent associated with short or low-value leases, the depreciation of property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets and the maintenance and running costs of properties and equipment. It also includes administrative expenses, including the provision of central support services, IT and other administrative costs.

## Other income

Other income comprises fair value movements on the financial asset, a profit share arrangement with Genesis Care, and recovery of insurance claims.

## Operating profit

Operating profit is the profit arising from the normal, recurring operations of the business and after charging adjusting items, as defined below. Operating profit is adjusted to exclude adjusting items to calculate the key performance indicator (KPI) 'operating profit before adjusting items (adjusted EBIT)'.

## Adjusting items

Adjusting items are those items which the directors believe, by virtue of their nature, size or incidence, either individually or in aggregate, should be disclosed separately to allow a full understanding and comparison of the underlying performance of the group. Examples of items which may be considered this way in nature include significant write-downs of goodwill and other assets, restructuring costs relating to strategic review, impairments, hospital closures and set-up costs, business acquisition costs, medical malpractice provisions, aborted project costs and compliance set-up costs.

## Taxation, including deferred taxation

Total income tax on the result for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity and other comprehensive income.

The group has applied the mandatory temporary exemption in IAS 12 Income Taxes to recognising and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes.

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable result for the year, using tax rates enacted, or substantively enacted, at the balance sheet date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years.

Where there is an uncertain tax position, a provision is recognised when it is not probable that the tax authority will accept the uncertain tax position, based on either the most likely amount where the range of results is binary, or as a weighted average of possible outcomes where a range of outcomes is possible.

Deferred tax is provided on all temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes, except for:

- Goodwill not deductible for tax purposes
- The initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and which, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor the taxable profit or loss and does not give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences
- Investments in subsidiary companies where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future

It should be noted that the initial recognition exception does not apply to the majority of the group's freehold property portfolio as these were acquired through the Bupa and Classics acquisitions in 2007 and 2008, which were accounted for as a business combination.

The amount of deferred tax recognised is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted, or substantively enacted, at the balance sheet date. The group offsets deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities if, and only if, it has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets and current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities which intend either to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or recovered.

In assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets, the group relies on the same forecast assumptions used elsewhere in the financial statements and in other management reports, which, among other things, reflect the potential impact of climate-related development on the business, such as increased costs as a result of measures to reduce carbon emission.

A deferred tax asset, subject to the offsetting above, is only recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be used.

## Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Major projects are treated as assets in the course of construction until completed when they are transferred to the appropriate asset class. No depreciation is charged on freehold land or assets in the course of construction. Other assets are depreciated so as to write off the carrying amounts of the assets, less their estimated residual values, over their expected useful lives, as follows:

| Freehold property and improvements   | - 5 to 60 years                                                            |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Leasehold improvements               | - lower of unexpired lease term or expected life, withamaximum of 35 years |
| Equipment                            | - 3 to 10 years                                                            |

The expected useful lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed semi-annually and revised as appropriate. The review of the asset lives and residual values of properties takes into consideration the plans of the business and levels of expenditure incurred on an ongoing basis to maintain the properties in a fit and proper state for their ongoing use as hospitals. In addition, the potential impact of future climate change is considered. In the case of major facilities opening in new locations, depreciation may be applied to only those assets available for use at the official opening date to reflect that the site is not always fully operational at this opening date.

## Consolidation

The results of all subsidiary undertakings are included in the consolidated financial statements. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date the group gains control until the date the group ceases to control the subsidiary.

Control is achieved when the group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Specifically, the group controls an investee if, and only if, the group has:

- Power over the investee (ie existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee)
- Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee
- The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns

The Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) is treated as an extension of the group and the company.

## Business combinations

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree. For each business combination, the group elects whether to measure the non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and included in other operating costs.

Overview

Strategic report

Governance report

Financial statements

Other information

The group determines that it has acquired a business when the acquired set of activities and assets include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. The acquired process is considered substantive if it is critical to the ability to continue producing outputs, and the inputs acquired include an organised workforce with the necessary skills, knowledge, or experience to perform that process or it significantly contributes to the ability to continue producing outputs and is considered unique or scarce or cannot be replaced without significant cost, effort, or delay in the ability to continue producing outputs.

When the group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date.

## Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition (being the fair value of consideration transferred) over the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of acquired businesses at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

Goodwill is allocated to one cash-generating unit or a group of cash-generating units and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if there is an indication that the value of the goodwill may be impaired (see impairment policy).

## Intangible assets other than goodwill

Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are recognised at cost and are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.

Intangible assets acquired on business combinations are recognised separately from goodwill at the acquisition date where it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the entity and the fair value of the asset can be measured reliably; the intangible asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights.

As at 31 December 2024 the intangible assets, other than goodwill are assessed to have finite lives.

Amortisation is recognised so as to write off the cost or carrying amounts of the assets, less their estimated residual values, over their expected useful lives, as follows:

| Customer contracts   | - 13 to 15 years                                                                          |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| IT projects          | - 5 years                                                                                 |
| Mobilisation costs   | - in line with relevant customer contract length which is typically between 5 to 10 years |

The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are considered to modify the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the statement of profit or loss in the expense category that is consistent with the function of the intangible assets.

## 2. Accounting policies continued

## Intangible assets other than goodwill continued

## Mobilisation costs

Mobilisation costs within intangible assets relate to set-up costs when a new NHS contract is won. These costs are incurred for the benefit of running the contract over its entire term and are classified as intangible assets as these costs are incremental costs of obtaining the contract as determined under IFRS 15. The group's policy is to capitalise these costs and amortise them over the fixed term of the contract on a straight-line basis.

## Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the group's cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of the statement of cash flows. There are no bank overdrafts in either year presented.

## Financial Instruments

A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.

## i) Financial assets other than derivatives

## Initial recognition and measurement

Financial assets are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI).

The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset's contractual cash flow characteristics and the group's business model for managing them. With the exception of trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the group has applied the practical expedient, the group initially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs. Trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the group has applied the practical expedient are measured at the transaction price determined under IFRS 15.

In order for a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortised cost or fair value through OCI, it needs to give rise to cash flows that are 'solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)' on the principal amount outstanding. This assessment is referred to as the SPPI test and is performed at an instrument level.

The group's business model for managing financial assets refers to how it manages its financial assets in order to generate cash flows. The business model determines whether cash flows will result from collecting contractual cash flows, selling the financial assets, or both.

The company's financial assets include cash and short-term deposits, trade and other receivables, unbilled receivables and receivables from profit share arrangements. Unbilled receivables may include contract assets where the performance obligation has been met, but the invoice not raised due to agreement with the customer being required in respect of the variable consideration. Unbilled receivables can also include amounts where the performance obligation has been met, but the invoice not yet raised due to the timing of the reporting period.

## Subsequent measurement

Trade receivables and unbilled receivables are accounted for at amortised cost. The group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses, which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables. At each reporting period, the group makes an assessment of the asset's recoverable amount based on forward-looking information. Losses arising from impairment are recognised in the consolidated income statement in other operating costs.

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. On initial recognition, loans and receivables are measured at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequently, such assets are measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate (EIR) method, less any allowance for impairment.

Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in interest receivable in the consolidated income statement.

Receivables relating to profit share arrangements are recognised as fair value through profit and loss. At each reporting period, the assets are revalued, with any movement in fair value being recognised in the consolidated income statement. Any cash received from profit share arrangements is presented within cash flows from investing activities within the cash flow statement.

## Derecognition

A financial asset is derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or the group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset including transferring substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset.

## Impairment

The group recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the group expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. The expected cash flows will include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms.

For trade receivables (including unbilled receivables), contract assets and lease receivables, the group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore, the group does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The group has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the receivables and the economic environment. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on shared characteristics and the days past due. The group has concluded that the expected loss rates for trade receivables, are a reasonable approximation of the loss rates for each ageing bucket based on historical debt trends of our portfolio of customers for the last two reporting periods, with the exception of patient debt. Patient debt is more susceptible to the economic environment. As a result, the group has reviewed the expected loss rates for this payor group, as well as considering forward-looking information (specifically the cost of living) and increased the loss rates accordingly.

Financial Instruments continued

## ii) Financial liabilities other than derivatives

Financial liabilities within the scope of IFRS 9 are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, or at amortised cost. The group determines the classification of financial liabilities at initial recognition.

## Initial recognition and measurement

All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and in the case of loans and borrowings, net of directly attributable transaction costs.

The group's financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings, and derivative financial instruments.

## Subsequent measurement

After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in interest receivable and interest payable in the consolidated income statement. Amortised cost is calculated by taking in to account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the consolidated income statement.

## Financial liabilities to purchase own equity instruments

Financial agreements entered into with non-controlling interests for the future purchase of the remaining interest is recognised as a financial liability measured initially at fair value where there is an obligation on the group to settle a liability. On initial recognition the financial liability is recognised through equity. In subsequent periods, the liability will be measured at amortised cost with changed in the expected cash flows recognised in the income statement. Cash flows are discounted using the weighted average cost of debt.

## Derecognition

A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the consolidated income statement.

## iii) Derivative financial instruments

The group may enter into derivative financial instrument arrangements to manage its exposure to interest rate risk. Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently remeasured at fair value at each balance sheet date. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.

The group applies cash flow hedge accounting to such derivatives if the criteria for doing so are met. At the inception of a hedge relationship, the group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which it wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge.

The effective portion of the changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. The cash flow hedge reserve is adjusted to the lower of the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument and the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item.

Overview

Strategic report

Governance report

Financial statements

Other information

Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item is recognised, in the same line of the income statement as the recognised hedged item. If cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued, the amount that has been accumulated in the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income is maintained if the hedged future cash flows are still expected to occur. Otherwise, the amount is immediately reclassified to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment.

## iv) Offsetting of financial instruments

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the consolidated balance sheet if, and only if, there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.

## Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost means purchase price, less trade discounts, calculated on an average basis. Net realisable value means estimated selling price less incremental costs including trade discounts and all costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.

The group holds consignment stock on sale or return. The group is only required to pay for the equipment it chooses to use and therefore this stock is not recognised as an asset.

## Borrowing costs

Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition and construction of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.

All other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.

## Provisions

A provision is recognised in the consolidated balance sheet when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected, risk-adjusted, future cash flows at a pre-tax risk-free rate. Management considers its best estimate of the likely outcomes of the obligation when determining the recognition. Where a material range of outcomes could arise, details are disclosed accordingly. Provisions are measured gross of any expected insurance recovery. Any such insurance recoveries are recognised in other receivables when the receipt of them is judged virtually certain.

## Leases

## i) As a lessee

At inception, the group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease. This assessment involves the exercise of judgement about whether the group obtains substantially all the economic benefits from the use of that asset, and whether the group has the right to direct the use of the asset when considering whether the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. After initial recognition, the lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. A reassessment of the lease liability occurs when there is a change in lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is only revised where the change in payments is a result of a change in floating interest rates, lease term change or a change in assessment relating to the exercise of purchase option charges.

The group has elected not to separate lease and non-lease components for leases of vehicles or buildings.

## 2. Accounting policies continued

Leases continued

The group recognises a Right-of-Use (ROU) asset and a lease liability at the commencement of the lease. The ROU is initially measured based on the present value of lease payments, less any incentives received. Initial direct costs and costs to dismantle or restore an asset are included. The ROU is depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the underlying asset. The incremental borrowing rate is used to discount the assets over the relevant term. The ROU is subject to testing for impairment if there is an indicator for impairment.

Lease payments generally include fixed payments and variable payments that depend on an index (such as inflation index) or rate. When the lease contains an extension or purchase option that the group considered reasonably certain to be exercised, the cost of the option is included in the lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is used to discount the lease payments over the term of the lease.

ROU assets are categorised to reflect the nature of the underlying asset and to be consistent with the plant, property and equipment (PPE) note. The assets are depreciated over the term of the lease, accounting for break clauses or options to extend in line with the lease liability decision.

ROU assets are disclosed as PPE on the balance sheet (non-current) with a separate disclosure within the associated note, and the lease liability is included in the headings lease liability (current and non-current) on the Consolidated balance sheet.

The group has elected not to recognise ROU assets and liabilities for leases where the total lease term is less than 12 months, or for leases of low-value equipment. The payments for such leases are recognised in the Consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

## ii) As a lessor

When the group acts as a lessor, leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessees, over the major part of the economic life of the asset. All other leases are classified as operating leases. If an arrangement contains lease and non-lease components, the group applies IFRS 15 to allocate the consideration in the contract. When the group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease separately, classifying the sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease instead of the underlying asset.

## Share capital

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are deducted from share premium. Where the employee benefit trust purchases the company's equity share capital, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs, is deducted from equity attributable to the company's equity holders in both the company and the consolidated balance sheet until the shares are cancelled or reissued.

## Dividend distribution

Dividend distribution to the company's shareholders is recognised as a liability in the group's financial statements in the period in which the dividend is approved by the company's shareholders. Interim dividends are recognised when paid.

## Pensions

The group operates the Spire Healthcare Pension Plan, a defined contribution scheme. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the group in independently administered funds.

Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.

## Other employee benefits

Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. A provision is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonuses if the group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

## Share-based payments

The group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based payment schemes under which the group receives services from employees as consideration for equity instruments of the group. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense. The group has estimated the relevant fair value of the share options and awards, which are subject to total shareholder return (TSR) market-related performance criteria, using a Monte Carlo simulation model (see Note 29). This applies to LTIP Awards and Deferred Share Bonus Schemes.

The group also operates a Save As You Earn (SAYE) scheme, which is open to all employees. Employees are required to save a fixed amount, up to a cap, every month for three years. At the end of the three-year period employees are entitled to use their savings to purchase shares in the company at a stated exercise price. Employees are free to stop contributing to the scheme and obtain a refund of contributions at any time, but forfeit their entitlement to exercise the options if they do so. Payment of contributions into a SAYE scheme is not a vesting condition; it does not meet the definition of a performance condition because it has no link to service. Failure to meet a non-vesting condition (eg by ceasing to contribute to an SAYE scheme) is accounted for as a cancellation of the options so that the expense is accelerated and recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity as required. The IFRS 2 charge has been calculated using an adjusted Black Scholes model with judgements including leavers of the scheme (employees who may cease to save) and dividend yields.

At the end of each year, the group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the non-market conditions and recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.

## Non-current assets held for sale

Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.

Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.

## Impairment

The group applies its impairment policy to non-financial assets, being intangible assets (goodwill), plant, property and equipment, and right-of-use assets. The group assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the group estimates the asset's recoverable amount. An asset's recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's or cash generating units (CGU)'s fair value less costs of disposal or its value-in-use. The recoverable amounts is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired, and is written down to its recoverable amount.

In assessing value-in-use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the asset. As part of this, the group assesses where climate risks could have a significant impact, such as the introduction of emission-reduction legislation that may increase costs. These risks in relation to climate-related matters are included as key assumptions where they materially impact the measure of recoverable amount. The group bases its impairment calculation on most recent budgets and forecast calculations, which are prepared for each CGU. The forecasts generally cover a five-year period. A long-term growth rate is calculated and applies to project future cash flows after the fifth year.

Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the consolidated income statement in other operating costs. Impairment is likely to be considered an adjusting item.

For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date to determine whether there is an indication that previously recognised impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. If such indication exists, the group estimates the asset's or CGU's recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as at 31 December and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.

Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of each CGU (or group of CGUs) to which the goodwill relates. When the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised. Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually as at 31 December at the CGU level, as appropriate, and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.

As the group prepares its financial statements in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB as endorsed by the UK, the application of new standards and interpretations will result in an effective date subject to that agreed by the UK Endorsement process.

We are in the process of assessing the impact of the above on the presentation of and disclosure in the financial statements.

## 3. Critical accounting judgements and estimates

In the application of the group's accounting policies, the directors are required to make judgements and estimates about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

## Judgements

## Adjusting items

Judgements are required as to whether items that are material in size, unusual or infrequent in nature should be disclosed as adjusting items. Deciding which items meet the respective definitions requires the group to exercise its judgement. Details of these items categorised as adjusting items are outlined in Note 11.

## Leases

The application of IFRS 16 requires the group to make certain judgements which affect the value of the ROU asset and lease liability, and these include: determining contracts in the scope of IFRS 16 and the contract term.

## 3. Critical accounting judgements and estimates continued

## Leases continued

The lease term is determined by the group and includes the non-cancellable period of lease contracts, periods covered by an option to extend the lease if the group is reasonably certain to exercise that option and period covered by an option to terminate the lease if the group is reasonably certain not to exercise that option. The group reviews the business plan, investment in leasehold improvements and market conditions when considering the certainty of options to extend or terminate. For lease contracts with an indefinite term, the group determines the length of the contract to be equal to the average or typical market contract term of the particular type of lease. The same life is then applied to determine the depreciation rate of ROU assets.

## Significant accounting estimates

The preparation of the group's consolidated financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions. The significant accounting estimates with a significant risk of a material change to the carrying value of assets and liabilities within the next year in terms of IAS 1, 'Presentation of Financial Statements', are:

## Goodwill

Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if there is an indication that goodwill may be impaired. This is achieved by comparing the carrying value in the accounts with the recoverable amount (being the value-in-use), as set out in the impairment policy. The value-in-use calculations require the group to estimate future cash flows expected to arise in the future, taking into account market conditions. The current value of goodwill is underpinned by these forecasts. The present value of these cash flows is determined using an appropriate discount rate.

The assumptions are considered to be most critical in reviewing goodwill for impairment are contained in note 15.

## Property impairment

Property, including property ROU assets, is considered for indicators of impairment at each reporting date, or earlier if a trigger indicates, as set out in the impairment policy. The recoverable amount, being the value-in-use, requires the group to estimate cash flows expected to arise in the future, taking into account market conditions. The variables in the cash flows are interdependent and reflect management's expectations based on past experience and current market trends, it takes into account both current business and committed initiatives. The present value of these cash flows is determined using an appropriate discount rate.

The assumptions are considered to be most critical in reviewing properties for impairment are contained in note 14.

## Other areas of accounting estimates

The consolidated financial statements include other areas of judgement and accounting estimates. While these areas do not meet the definition under IAS 1 of significant accounting estimates and critical accounting judgements, the recognition and measurement of certain material assets and liabilities are based on assumptions and/or are subject to longer-term uncertainties. The other areas of accounting estimates and judgement are:

## Leases

The present value of the lease payment is determined using the discount factor (incremental borrowing rate) which is based on a risk free UK gilt rate plus an applicable credit spread or margin to reflect the credit standing of the group observed in the period when the lease contract commences or is modified. The incremental borrowing rate applied reflects a rate for a similar term and security to that of the lease and is determined at inception.

Details of incremental borrowing rates can be found in note 23.

## Expected credit losses

The group has not changed the methodology in respect of the expected credit loss (ECL) calculations. The group's customer profile includes large organisations that have stable credit ratings, and the payment profiles have remained stable for historical debts. The exception to this is patient debt where economic circumstances can have a significant impact and, given the current economic uncertainty, remains the highest risk for the group. The ECL as at December 2024 is £6.2 million (December 2023: £5.5 million). See note 19.

## Provisions for medical malpractice

The provision was established by Spire Healthcare in respect of implementing the recommendations of the Independent Inquiry including a detailed patient review and support for patients of Paterson. The provision is utilised for patient claim settlements. The variables include the number of patients which are found to have been harmed and the associated compensation claim. The project is complex and the process for settlement of claims, where relevant, takes some time. It is possible that, as further information becomes available, an adjustment to this provision will be required, but at this time, it reflects management's best estimate of the costs and settlement of claims. This provision remains subject to ongoing review.

Details of the provision can be found in note 26.

## Climate-related risk and opportunities on the financial statements

To date, the board has not identified any climate-related risks or opportunities that would have a material impact on the assets or liabilities of the group, and therefore has not adjusted financial balances for climaterelated risks or opportunities.

## 4. Revenue

All revenue is attributable to, and all non-current assets are located in, the United Kingdom. Revenue by location (inpatient, day case or out-patient) and wider customer (payor) group is shown below:

1.   Other revenue includes fees paid to the group by consultants (eg for the use of group facilities and services) and third-party revenue (eg pathology services to third parties).

Group revenues increased 11.2% to £1,511.2 million (2023: £1,359.0 million). Hospitals business revenue has increased by 4.7% to £1,390.2 million (2023: £1,327.6 million), driven by the demand for private healthcare and our expansion into Primary Care. Overall revenue growth is underpinned by increased average revenue per case (APRC) for all payor groups Revenue for primary care is £121.0 million (2023: £31.4 million), with the majority of this from Vita Health Group, which was acquired in October 2023.

## 5. Segmental reporting

In determining the group's operating segments, management has primarily considered the financial information in internal reports that are reviewed and used by the executive management team and board of directors (who together are the chief operating decision maker of Spire Healthcare) in assessing performance and in determining the allocation of resources. The financial information in those internal reports in respect of revenue and expenses has led management to conclude that the group has three operating segments, being the hospitals business, Vita Health Group and The Doctors Clinic Group.

The hospitals business is the group's core business activity and consists of hospitals, clinics, medical centres and consulting rooms. They provide diagnostics, inpatient, day case and outpatient care in areas including orthopaedics, gynaecology, cardiology, neurology, oncology and general surgery.

We have aggregated Vita Health Group and The Doctors Clinic Group into one reportable segment called primary care, as they meet the aggregation criteria under IFRS 8 operating segments. These entities all have similar economic characteristics such as offering similar services and have a similar type of customer. These services being primarily focused on the primary care needs of outpatients, whether these services are GP services, occupational health services or mental and physical health services.

Segment performance is evaluated based on profit or loss and is measured consistently with profit or loss in the consolidated financial statements. The balance sheet is evaluated on a group level.

The fair value movement in respect of the financial asset was recognised to reflect the on-going profit share arrangement with Genesis Care which arose as part of the sale of the Bristol Cancer Centre in 2019. Profits of £1.0 million (2023: £0.8 million) have been realised in respect of this arrangement. The fair value movement on financial liability relates to the change in cash flows relating to the financial instruments held to purchase own equity instruments.

## 11. Adjusting items continued

Adjusting items comprise those matters where the directors believe the financial effect should be adjusted for, due to their nature, size or incidence, in order to provide a more accurate comparison of the group's underlying performance.

Asset acquisitions, disposals, impairment and aborted project credit of £2.8 million includes a profit of £4.5 million relating to the sale of the group's Tunbridge Wells hospital to Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust ('Trust') for £9.975 million. Refer to disposal note 35 for more details. In addition, there is £0.6 million of integration and other acquisition costs relating to the VHG acquisition and £0.6 million true up to provision on the DCG and Claremont acquisitions.

In the prior year, costs of £3.1 million mainly relate to asset acquisitions of Vita Health Group Limited and The Doctors Clinic Group.

Business reorganisation and corporate restructuring relates to the group announcement of a strategic, groupwide initiative in H2 of 2021 that will enable a more efficient business operating model, including leveraging digital solutions and technology. As a result of this initiative, additional costs of £3.5 million (2023: £2.0 million) have been incurred in the period, bringing costs to date of £9.3 million. This initiative is being implemented over several phases and is likely to be materially completed during 2026, as communicated at our capital markets event in April 2024. Future costs are not disclosed, as a reliable estimate cannot be made due to the nature of the matter. £0.7 million has been incurred in respect of restructuring costs relating to the The Doctors Clinic Group.

Remediation of regulatory compliance or malpractice costs reflect an increase in the provision in June 2024 of £4.6 million (2023: £2.5 million). The provision was established by Spire Healthcare in respect of implementing the recommendations of the Independent Inquiry including a detailed patient review and support for patients of Paterson. The project is complex, and the process for review and settlement of claims, where relevant, takes some time. The detailed patient review has now reached the milestone of having contacted all living patients and invited them, where appropriate, to consultations to discuss their care. As a consequence, the rate of new claims has dropped significantly, as most patients now have the outcomes of their review and have initiated their claim, where relevant. Claims activity in the second half of the year has therefore been in line with the assumptions taken by management and the provision established at the half year. As a result, there has been no subsequent increase in the provision. In addition, £1.7 million of legal fees have been incurred for the ongoing inquests. While it is possible that, as further information becomes available, an adjustment to this provision will be required, at this time it reflects management's best estimate of the costs and settlement of claims.

In the prior year the group has recognised a credit of £0.9 million in respect of Remediation of Regulatory Compliance or Malpractice Costs relating to Paterson. This comprised £2.5 million funds received from its insurer and £0.9 million reduction in provision which had been held to resolve the matter. This was offset by an increased separate provision in respect of Paterson by £2.5 million.

Clinic set up costs relate to costs incurred for the set-up of the Abergele and Harrogate clinics prior to opening. The clinic in Abergele opened in February 2024 and Harrogate in January 2025.

£0.9 million of amortisation on acquired intangible assets related to the customer contracts recognised on the acquisition of VHG in October 2023.

| Total tax charge                                  | 12.3   | 6.7    |

In addition to the above, a credit of £0.3 million has been recognised in Other Comprehensive income (2023: £0.9 million credit) and £0.4 million credit (2023: £0.3 million credit) through equity. The £0.4 million credit through equity relates to movements on share-based payments, and reflects a £0.5 million deferred tax charge, offset by a current tax credit of £0.9 million.

Corporation tax is calculated at 25.0% (2023: 23.5%) of the estimated taxable profit or loss for the year. The effective tax rate on profit before taxation for the year is 32.1%. The effective tax rate is higher than the UK rate, due to the impact of prior year adjustments and non-deductible items. Excluding the adjustments to prior years in 2024, the effective tax rate is 28.1%.

The effective tax assessed for the year, all of which arises in the UK, differs from the standard weighted rate of corporation tax in the UK. The reconciliation of the actual tax charge to that at the domestic corporation tax rate is as follows:

| (£m)                                             | 2024   | 2023   |
|--------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|
| Profit before taxation                           | 38.3   | 34.6   |

| Expenses and income not deductible or taxable    | 1.1    | 3.2    |
| Adjustment for movement on share-based payments  | 0.3    | -      |
| Tax adjustment for the super-deduction allowance | -      | (0.8)  |
| Adjustments in respect of prior year             | 1.3    | (4.2)  |
| Difference in tax rates                          | -      | 0.2    |
| Deferred tax not previously recognised           | -      | 0.2    |
| Total tax charge                                 | 12.3   | 6.7    |

Expenses and income not deductible or taxable relate mostly to depreciation on non-qualifying fixed assets, disallowable entertaining, and legal and professional fees.

The current year and prior year charges are driven by expenses not deductible for tax purposes, adjustments to prior year and the movement on share-based payments.

The group does not hold any uncertain tax positions under IFRIC 23 at the year-end (2023: none).

## 12. Taxation continued

Pillar Two Legislation, reflecting the OECDs Base Erosion Profit Shifting ('BEPs') framework is effective for periods beginning 1 January 2024. The group continues to only operate in the UK. Based on the group's assessment, the Pillar Two effective tax rates continue to be above 15% and therefore, the group does not expect an exposure to Pillar Two top-up taxes.

## 13. Earnings per share (EPS)

Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.

|                                                                                | 2024        | 2023        |

| Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue (No.)                      | 403,493,123 | 403,648,886 |
| Basic earnings per share (in pence per share)                                  | 6.3         | 6.8         |

For dilutive EPS, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to include all dilutive potential ordinary shares arising from share options. Refer to the remuneration committee report for the terms and conditions of instruments generating potential ordinary shares that affect the measurement of diluted EPS.

|                                                                                | 2024        | 2023        |

| Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue (No.)                      | 403,493,123 | 403,648,886 |
| Adjustment for weighted average number of contingently issuable shares         | 7,900,003   | 9,494,645   |
| Diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue (No.)              | 411,393,127 | 413,143,531 |
| Diluted earnings per share (in pence per share)                                | 6.2         | 6.6         |

The directors believe that EPS excluding adjusting items (adjusted EPS) better reflects the underlying performance of the business and assists in providing a clearer view of the performance of the group.

Reconciliation of profit after taxation to profit after taxation excluding adjusting items (adjusted profit):

## 14. Property, plant and equipment continued

On the 31 March 2024, the Group sold its Tunbridge Wells Hospital business to Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust for £9.975 million and derecognised property, plant and equipment of £6.2 million. As part of the sale agreement, the group has entered into a sub lease agreement with the trust to lease the Tunbridge Wells property (refer to note 23). A right of use asset of £2.4 million was derecognised and a finance lease receivable of £4.4 million was recognised. The finance lease receivable represents the cash flows receivable from the trust to settle the lease obligation in the head lease. Refer to note 23 for more details.

## Impairment testing

The directors consider property and property right-of-use assets for indicators of impairment semi-annually. As equipment and leasehold improvements do not generate independent cash flows, they are considered alongside the property as a single cash-generating unit (CGU). When making the assessment, the value-in-use of the property is compared with its carrying value in the accounts. Where headroom is significant, no further work is undertaken. Where headroom is minimal, a detailed assessment is performed for the property, which includes identifying the factors resulting in limited headroom and undertaking financial forecasts to assess the level of sensitivity this has to key assumptions.

In order to estimate the value-in-use, management has used trading projections covering the period to December 2029 from the most recent board approved strategic plan. The variables in the cash flows are interdependent and reflect management's expectations based on past experience and current market trends, it takes into account both current business and committed initiatives. To the extent that there was a shortfall between the recent actual cash flows and forecast, the future cash flows have been adjusted to reflect any initiatives implemented by management to address the underlying cause. In addition, management consider the potential financial impact from short-term climate change scenarios, and the cost of initiatives that have substantially commenced by the group to manage the longer-term climate impacts.

## Key assumptions

Management identified a number of key assumptions relevant to the value-in-use calculations, being EBITDA growth over the five-year period, capital maintenance spend, discount rates and long-term growth rates. The assumptions are based on past experience and external sources of information.

The trading projections for the five-year period underlying the value-in-use reflect a growth in EBITDA. EBITDA is based on a number of elements of the operating model over the longer term, including pricing trends, volume growth and the mix and complexity of procedures and assumptions regarding cost inflation.

Management has performed a sensitivity analysis on these properties using reasonably possible changes for each key assumption, keeping all other assumptions constant. The sensitivity analysis included an assessment of the break-even point for each of the key assumptions.

The sensitivity analysis identified two properties that a reasonably possible change would eliminate the headroom of the property. One property with a headroom of £9.1 million is sensitive to the EBITDA growth over the five year period as it, would result in the elimination of headroom. The average annual EBITDA growth over the five years is 11.4%. The annual EBITDA over the five year period would have to decrease by 5.8% per annum to eliminate the headroom. Another property with a headroom of £3.4 million is sensitive to the discount rate which would need to increase by 155bps to result in the elimination of the headroom.

During the 2023 financial year, the group moved to a post IFRS 16 discount rate, the group has used a pre-tax discount rate of 11.2% (2023: 11.5%).

Overview

Strategic report

Governance report

Financial statements

A long-term growth rate of 2.0% has been applied to cash flows beyond 2029 based on a long-term view of inflation, revenue growth and market conditions. Capital maintenance spend is based on historic run rates and our expectations of the group's requirements. The sensitivity testing identified no reasonably possible changes in the discount rate, capital maintenance and long-term growth rates that would cause the carrying amount of any CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.

As a result, management believe that some of the key impairment review assumptions constitute a major source of estimation uncertainty as they consider that there is a significant risk of a material change to its estimate of these assumptions within the next 12 months.

## Impairment testing

The directors treat the hospitals business, Vita Health Group and The Doctors Clinic Group as separate cash-generating units for the purposes of testing goodwill for impairment as the goodwill can be reliably allocated. The recoverable amount of goodwill is calculated by reference to its estimated value-in-use. In order to estimate the value-in-use, management has used trading projections covering the period to December 2029 from the most recent board-approved budget. The variables in the cash flows are interdependent and reflect management's expectations based on past experience and current market trends, it takes into account both current business and committed initiatives. In addition, management consider the potential financial impact from short-term climate change scenarios, and the cost of initiatives by the group to manage the longer-term climate impacts.

## Key assumptions

Management identified a number of key assumptions relevant to the value-in-use calculations, being EBITDA growth over the five-year period, capital maintenance spend, discount rates and long-term growth rates. The assumptions are based on past experience and external sources of information.

The table below provides the resulting headroom as determined in our calculation.

|                                  |   Goodwill £m | Headroom £m   |
|----------------------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Hospitals business               |         334.6 | 1,136.2       |
| Vita Health Group ('VHG')        |          65.9 | 68.0          |
| The Doctors Clinic Group ('DCG') |          11.1 | 0.5           |

The trading projections for the five-year period underlying the value-in-use reflect a growth in EBITDA. EBITDA is dependent on a number of elements of the operating model over the longer term, including pricing trends, volume growth and the mix and complexity of procedures and assumptions regarding cost inflation.

The group has used a pre-tax post discount rate of 11.2% (2023: 11.5%).

A long-term growth rate of 2.0% has been applied to cash flows beyond 2029 based on long-term view of inflation and market conditions. Capital maintenance spend is based on historic run rates and our expectation of the group's requirements.

Management has performed a sensitivity analysis using reasonably possible changes for each key assumption, keeping all other assumptions constant. The sensitivity testing for the hospitals business and Vita Health Group identified no reasonably possible changes would cause the carrying amount of any CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.

The Doctors Clinic Group is a younger maturity CGU and, during the year, made a small loss owing to the effect of integration costs and one-off investments in new clinics and infrastructure. The growth rates used in the five-year period are based on the return from this investment and integration with Vita Health Group and the wider group, therefore management have determined there is no impairment. However owing to these factors uncertainty exists in the key assumptions and we have determined that reasonable possible changes exists which could lead to an impairment.

The value in use calculation uses an average EBITDA growth over the five-year period of 61.8%. A change in the three key assumptions would result in the elimination of the headroom, being an increase of 78bps in the pre-tax discount rate and a decrease in the average EBITDA growth rate to 58.3% resulting in a decrease of 5.7% per annum over the five year period and a decrease of 42bps in the long-term growth rate.

A reasonable possible change in the three key assumptions that would result in the recognition of an impairment would be a decrease in the average EBITDA growth rate to 30.9% resulting in a decrease of 50.0% per annum over the five year period this would result in an impairment of £3.4 million. In addition, an increase of 230bps in the pre-tax discount rate would result in a £0.8 million impairment and a decrease of 1.0% in the long-term growth rate would lead to a £0.7 million impairment. The capital maintenance assumption did not identify a reasonable possible change.

As a result, management believe that some of the key impairment review assumptions constitute a major source of estimation uncertainty as they consider that there is a significant risk of a material change to its estimate of these assumptions within the next 12 months.

## 16. Financial assets

Financial assets of £14.8 million (2023: £10.0 million) consist of a £12.3 million (2023: £7.5 million) profit share arrangement and a prepayment of the Montefiore option to purchase the remaining 25% interest of £2.5 million (2023: £2.5 million). The prepayment of the Montefiore option to purchase is classified as current as the option has been exercised after the year end. Refer to note 24 for further information relating to the non-controlling interest option.

On 31 October 2019, the group entered into a profit share arrangement with Genesis Care. The agreement provides the group with an entitlement to a gross profit share relating to the chemotherapy business transferred to Genesis Care as part of the sale of the Bristol Cancer Centre in perpetuity. Under the agreement after the ten-year anniversary of the agreement, the buyer (Genesis Care) may exit the arrangement by serving notice and paying a multiple of ten times the gross margin in the preceding 12 months.

## 16. Financial assets continued

The group has recognised a financial asset in respect of this gross profit share and the asset is classed as a fair value through profit and loss asset. The financial asset is valued using the expected present value technique method 2 in determining the fair value. Management uses forward looking and historical trends of gross profits, growth rate, risk premium and an appropriate discount rate to determine the fair value. At the inception of the transaction we applied a risk premium to the fair value of the asset reflecting the fact that it was a new venture and so any future forecast cashflows contained an element of uncertainty. This risk premium has been reduced over time and reflects our growing confidence in the operation's ability to hit its future forecasts. Sensitivities are also taken into account when reviewing the fair value.

This valuation is reviewed at each reporting date, with movements in fair value being recognised through the consolidated income statement. Cash received is adjusted against the financial asset, and is included within cash flows from investing activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows.

|--------------------------------|--------|--------|
| Valuation at 1 January         | 7.5    | 4.6    |

| Fair value adjustments         | 5.8    | 3.7    |
| Carrying amount at 31 December | 12.3   | 7.5    |

Management completes relevant sensitivities on the inputs when assessing the fair value.

With all other inputs remaining constant:

- A 1.2% increase (decrease) in the discount rate used, would see a decrease (increase) in fair value of £1.0 million (£1.3 million) (2023: 1.2% increase (decrease) £0.8 million (£0.6 million))
- A 20% increase (decrease) in the forecast annual cash flow of £0.19 million (2023: £0.16 million), would see an increase (decrease) in fair value of £2.3 million (£2.3 million) (2023: £1.4 million (£1.4 million)).

# In liquidation and expected to be dissolved during 2025.

## 17. Subsidiary undertakings and non-controlling interest continued

In 2021, in order to simplify the structure of the group and reduce costs, the group undertook a process in which a number of companies within the group were identified for members' voluntary liquidation. The entities in members' voluntary liquidation at year end are shown above and they are expected to be formally dissolved at Companies House during 2025.

## Non-controlling interest

Financial information of subsidiaries that have a material non-controlling interest is provided below. The entities, as set out above, are Montefiore House Limited and Didsbury MSK Limited. In 2023, Spire Healthcare acquired an additional 24.9% interest in Montefiore House Limited, and now owns 75.1% of this entity. The accumulated interest relating to Montefiore has therefore been reclassified to retained earnings.

Within the entities, the most material assets and liabilities relate to right of use assets and lease liabilities in respect of property. Except for the lease rental payments, the majority of cash flows are generated through operations. In 2023, the group entered into an agreement with the non-controlling interest of Montefiore House Limited, in which both parties can exercise an option for Spire to purchase the remaining 25% interest in the subsidiary at a future date. The purchase price is calculated in line with pre-determined metrics which are based on the subsidiary's EBITDA performance and the group multiple.

Unbilled receivables reflects work in progress where a patient had treatment, or was receiving treatment, at the end of the period and the invoice had not yet been raised.

Other receivables of £6.2 million includes £4.3 million insurance reimbursement right (2023: £4.6 million); and £1.3 million (2023: £4.1 million) reimbursement right related to the Paterson fund.

The Paterson fund is being held by solicitors on account until payments are made, with any amount not paid out being returned to Spire Healthcare. During the year, £4.7 million was paid out of this fund and an additional £1.4 million was paid into the fund. The amounts paid to the Paterson fund do not reflect an investment in a financial asset, but merely a right to reimbursement should the fund not be utilised in full.

## 19. Trade and other receivables continued

Trade receivables comprise amounts due from private medical insurers, the NHS, self-pay patients, consultants and other third parties who use the group's facilities. Invoices to customers fall due within 60 days of the date of issue.

The group was successful in its bid to be included on the NHSE Framework for purchasing additional activity from the independent sector, which commenced in April 2021. Inclusion on the framework is at an agreed price for activity, based on the NHS tariff, but carries no guaranteed volumes. For contracts under the framework that include an estimated contract value, billing is in advance for the expected volume, with a quarterly true-up for actual volumes undertaken. For contracts under the framework without an estimated contract value (which can include local agreements), billing is in arrears based on actual volumes only.

The ageing of trade receivables is shown below and shows amounts that are past due at the reporting date (excluding payments on account where there is no right to offset these at the reporting date). A provision for expected credit losses has been recognised at the reporting date through consideration of the ageing profile of the group's trade receivables and the perceived credit quality of its customers reflecting net debt due. The carrying amount of trade receivables, net of expected credit losses, is considered to be an approximation to its fair value.

The loss allowance as at 31 December 2024 for trade receivables was determined as follows:

|                                           | Current   | 0-30 days   | 31-90 days   | 91-364 days   | 1-2 years   | Total   |

Trade receivables are written off when there is no longer a reasonable expectation of recovery. Indicators that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery include, among others, the failure of a debtor to engage in a repayment plan with the group, and failure to make contractual payments for a period of greater than two years past due.

The group assesses on a forward-looking basis expected credit losses associated with its debt instruments carried at amortised cost. The impairment methodology applied for trade receivables is the simplified approach, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the trade receivables.

Overview

Financial statements

Trade receivables after expected credit losses comprise the following wider customer/payor groups:

| (£m)                     |   2024 |   2023 |
|--------------------------|--------|--------|
| Private medical insurers |   31.1 |   29.5 |
| NHS                      |   30.7 |   25   |
| Patient debt             |    6   |    4.1 |
| Other                    |    9.1 |   10.7 |
|                          |   76.9 |   69.3 |

The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables during the year was as follows:

| (£m)                     | 2024   | 2023   |
|--------------------------|--------|--------|
| At 1 January             | 5.5    | 5.0    |
| Provided in the year     | 2.0    | 1.6    |
| Utilised during the year | (0.3)  | (0.3)  |
| Released during the year | (1.0)  | (0.9)  |
| At 31 December           | 6.2    | 5.5    |

The group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring Expected Credit Losses (ECLs) for trade receivables. Under this standard, lifetime ECL provisions are recognised for trade receivables using a matrix of rates dependent on age thresholds and customer types. The ECL rates are determined with reference to historical performance of each payor age group during the last two years.

To develop the ECL matrix, trade receivables were grouped according to shared characteristics (payor/payor type) and the days past due. As the majority of the group's debt is receivable from large, well-funded insurance companies, the National Health Service or from a large number of individuals, the group has concluded that historical debt performance of the portfolio during the last two reporting periods provides a reasonable approximation of the future expected loss rates for each payor age category.

## 20. Cash and cash equivalents

| (£m)                |   2024 |   2023 |
|---------------------|--------|--------|

|                     |   41.2 |   49.6 |

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, short-term deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments (including money market funds) with maturities not exceeding three months placed with investment grade counterparties which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.

## 21. Non-current assets held for sale

As at 31 December 2024 the group's management have committed to sell a parcel of land at Bostocks Lane as the group has accepted an offer on the property. The sale is considered highly probable and the assessment has not changed. It therefore remains as classified as held for sale.

## Capital reserves

This reserve represents the loans of £376.1 million due to the former ultimate parent undertaking and management that were forgiven by those counterparties as part of the reorganisation of the group prior to the IPO in 2014.

## Capital redemption reserve

During the year, the group announced a share buyback programme, the company redeemed 1,388,749 shares with a nominal value of £0.01 per share, resulting in a transfer of £13,887 from distributable profits to the Capital redemption reserve.

## EBT share reserves

Equiniti Trust (Jersey) Limited is acting in its capacity as trustee of the company's Employee Benefit Trust (EBT). The purpose of the EBT is to further the interests of the company by benefitting employees and former employees of the group and certain of their dependants. The EBT is treated as an extension of the group and the company.

During the year, the EBT purchased 1,312,000 shares and transferred 1,235,976 (2023: 1,339,634 shares acquired and 1,054,620 transferred) in order to settle share awards in relation to the directors' share bonus award and Long-Term Incentive Plan.

Where the EBT purchases the company's equity share capital the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs, is deducted from equity attributable to the company's equity holders until the shares are cancelled or reissued. As at 31 December 2024, 388,184 shares (2023: 312,160) were held by the EBT in relation to the directors' share bonus award and Long-Term Incentive Plan. The EBT share reserve represents the consideration paid when the EBT purchases the company's equity share capital, until the shares are reissued.

As with prior years, the company will continue to fund the Spire Healthcare Employee Benefit Trust (EBT), a discretionary trust held for the benefit of the group's employees, for the ongoing acquisition of shares to satisfy the exercise of share plan awards by employees.

## Hedging reserve

The balance of £2.1 million at 31 December 2024 (2023: £3.3 million) reflects the £4.3 million debit (2023: £4.4 million debit) recycled in the period, the fair value credit of £2.8 million (2023: £0.2 million credit) and the £0.3 million tax credit on the profit (2023: £0.9 million credit) to give a net movement of a decrease of £1.2 million during the year (2023: a decrease of £3.3 million) on a hedged transaction. See note 23 for further information.

## 23. Borrowings

The group has borrowings in two forms, bank borrowings and lease liabilities as disclosed on the consolidated balance sheet. Total borrowings at 31 December 2024 were £1,279.9 million (2023: £1,257.0 million). More detail in respect of these two forms of borrowings are set out below.

## Bank borrowings

The bank loans are secured on fixed and floating charges over both the present and future assets of material subsidiaries of the group. On 24 February 2022, the group successfully refinanced its debt facilities with a syndicate of existing and new lenders. The arrangement has a maturity of February 2027. The financial covenants relating to this new agreement are materially unchanged. The loan is non-amortising and carries interest at a margin of 2.05% over SONIA (2023: 2.05% over SONIA).

| (£m)                                       |   2024 |   2023 |
|--------------------------------------------|--------|--------|
| Amount due for settlement within 12 months |    3.6 |    3.4 |
| Amount due for settlement after 12 months  |  363.5 |  361.9 |
| Total bank borrowings                      |  367.1 |  365.3 |

## Terms and debt repayment schedule

The maturity date is the date on which the relevant bank loans are due to be fully repaid.

The carrying amounts drawn (after issue costs and including interest accrued) under facilities in place at the balance sheet date were as follows:

| (£m)                      | Maturity      | Margin over SONIA   |   2024 |   2023 |

## 23. Borrowings continued

## Terms and debt repayment schedule continued

Net debt for the purposes of the covenant test in respect of the Senior Loan Facility was £323.8 million (2023: £315.4 million) and the net debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.0x (2023: 2.2x). The net debt for covenant purposes comprises the senior facility of £325.0 million, drawn revolving credit facility of £40.0 million less cash and cash equivalents of £41.2 million. EBITDA for covenant purposes comprises Adjusted EBITDA for Last Twelve Months (LTM) of pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA of £171.1 million (2023: £152.9 million) less the rental of a finance lease pre-IFRS 16 of £10.4 million (2023: £10.0 million).

The interest cover for covenant purposes was 7.5x (2023: 8.5x) and is calculated as the pre-IFRS 16 EBITDA described above over pre-IFRS 16 finance costs paid.

The senior finance facility includes a sustainability-linked element connected to environmental and quality factors. The group also has access to a further £60.0 million through a committed and undrawn revolving credit facility to February 2027.

## Effect of covenants

The group's non-current bank borrowings include borrowings amounting to £365.0 million that contain covenants, which, if not met, would result in the borrowings becoming repayable on demand. These borrowings are otherwise repayable more than 12 months after the end of the reporting period. The financial covenants are tested by reference to the most recent consolidated financial statements of the group, namely, 30 June and 31 December each year. The financial covenants are for the leverage ratio to be below 4.0x and interest cover to be in excess of 4.0x. As at 31 December 2024, the group complied with all covenants as the leverage measure stood at 2.0x and interest cover of 7.5x and therefore bank borrowings remain classified as non-current liabilities. The group is not aware of any circumstances in which there will be a breach in financial covenants.

## Lease liabilities

The group has finance in respect of hospital properties, vehicles, office and medical equipment. The leases are secured on fixed and floating charges over both the present and future assets of material subsidiaries in the group. Leases, with a present value liability of £912.8 million (2023: £891.7 million), expire in various years to 2046 and carry incremental borrowing rates in the range 3.2% - 14.6% (2023: 3.1% - 14.6%). Rents in respect of hospital property leases are reviewed annually with reference to RPI or CPI, subject to assorted floors and caps. The discount rates used are calculated on a lease by lease basis, and are based on estimates of incremental borrowing rates. A movement in the incremental borrowing rate of 1% would result in an 7.5% movement in lease liability.

In the year, the group recognised charges of £3.4 million (2023: £3.8 million) of lease expenses relating to low value leases and £17.0 million (2023: £14.8 million) of lease expense in respect of short-term leases for which the exemption under IFRS 16 has been taken. Lease commitments for short term leases are not dissimilar to the expense recognised. The total cash outflow for leases is £122.7 million (2023: £118.8 million). The group has not made any variable lease payments in the year. The group is a lessor to one lease to external parties and has recognised a finance lease receivable of £4.4 million (2023: Nil). The terms of the sublease are the same as those contained in the head-lease. There have been no (2023: no) sale and leaseback transactions in the year. Where new leases have the right to extend and management is not reasonably certain to exercise the extension option, those future cash flows are not reflected in the lease liability balance. If the option to extend was exercised the lease liability would increase by £239 million.

During the year the group sold its Tunbridge Wells Hospital business to Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust. As part of the sale agreement, the group has entered into a sub lease agreement with the trust to lease the Tunbridge Wells property. The finance lease receivable represents the cash flows receivable from the trust to settle the lease obligation in the head lease.

Overview

Strategic report

Governance report

Financial statements

Some leases receive RPI increases on an annual basis which affects both the cash flow and interest charged on those leases. Except for this increase, cash flows and charges are expected to remain in line with current year. The cash flows above do not reflect any termination, extension or break clause options as management is reasonably certain that the options will not be exercised. There are no significant restrictions or covenants which impact the cash flows in respect of these leases.

See note 14 for more detail on the depreciation of the right-of-use (ROU) assets and note 10 for more detail on the interest expense relating to leases.

The group entered into interest rate swaps on the 25 July 2022. The movement in respect of derivatives reflects £4.3 million (2023: £4.4 million) recycled in the period and a £2.8 million credit (2023: £0.2 million credit) in fair value. All movements are reflected within other comprehensive income.

## Financial instruments to purchase non-controlling interest

In 2023 the group entered into an agreement with the non-controlling interest of one of its subsidiaries, Montefiore House Limited, in which both parties can exercise an option for Spire Healthcare to purchase the remaining 25% interest in the subsidiary at a future date. On 21 February 2025, Brighton Orthopaedic and Sports Injury Clinic Limited (BOSIC) formally notified Spire Healthcare of the intention to exercise their option.

The purchase price is calculated in line with pre-determined metrics which are based on the subsidiary's EBITDA performance and the group multiple. The option can be exercised between two to five years. The expected future cash flow to settle the obligation is discounted at the group cost of debt of 8.1%. The financial liability is initially recognised through equity at the present value of future cash flows and subsequently recognised at amortised cost.

Deferred tax on property, plant and equipment has arisen on differences between the carrying value of the relevant assets and the tax base.

On the acquisition of Vita Health Group, a deferred tax asset has been recognised for losses as they are expected to be available for utilisation across the wider group from the fifth anniversary of the acquisition date. In addition, a deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of fixed assets. On acquisition, the group has recognised an intangible asset in respect of customer contracts. A deferred tax liability of £5 million was recognised in the prior year and is unwinding in line with amortisation of the intangible in future years.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realised or the liability settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, at the balance sheet date. The group has separately calculated the tax rates applicable in respect of adjusting items for the period. Deferred tax in the current period continues to be measured at 25%.

Deferred tax assets are recognised on the basis that the deferred tax liabilities represent forecast profits of the appropriate type (either capital or trading) and therefore represent a suitable taxable profit against the reversal of the deferred tax assets can be offset. Deferred tax assets and liabilities in relation to property are only offset to the extent that they relate to the same site.

The group has unrecognised deferred tax assets (which do not expire) as follows:

|                                        | 2024   | 2024         | 2023   | 2023         |
|----------------------------------------|--------|--------------|--------|--------------|
| (£m)                                   | Gross  | Tax effected | Gross  | Tax effected |
| Trading losses                         | 10.4   | 2.6          | 11.7   | 2.6          |
| Tax basis for future capital disposals | 11.6   | 2.9          | 11.6   | 2.9          |
| Total                                  | 22.0   | 5.5          | 23.3   | 5.5          |

These amounts are the expected tax value of the gross temporary difference at the enacted long-term tax rate of 25% (2023: 25%). A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of these amounts due to uncertainties as to the timing of future profits that the trading losses could be offset against and tax basis for capital disposals could be utilised.

Medical malpractice relates to estimated liabilities arising from claims for damages in respect of services previously supplied to patients. During the period £4.6 million was added due to additional claims received, and £6.5 million utilised. Amounts are shown gross of insured liabilities. Any such insurance recoveries of £4.3 million (December 2023: £4.6 million) are recognised in other receivables.

## 26. Provisions continued

In response to the publication of the public inquiry report on Paterson on 4 February 2020, Spire Healthcare established a provision in respect of implementing the recommendations including a detailed patient review and support for patients. Since inception of the provision in 2021 £13.1 million has been utilised in settlement of patient claims. The provision to complete the reviews, settle any claims and costs in respect of other Paterson items has been increased by £4.6 million as reported in June 2024.

The provision was established by Spire Healthcare in respect of implementing the recommendations of the independent inquiry including a detailed patient review and support for patients of Paterson. The project is complex and the process for review and settlement of claims, where relevant, takes some time. The detailed patient review has now reached the milestone of having contacted all living patients and invited them, where appropriate, to consultations to discuss their care. As a consequence, the rate of new claims has dropped significantly, as most patients now have their outcomes of their review and have initiated their claim, where relevant. Claims activity in the second half of the year has therefore been in line with the assumptions taken by management and the provision established at the half year. As a result there has been no subsequent increase in the provision. In addition, £1.7 million of legal fees have been incurred for the ongoing inquests. While it is possible that, as further information becomes available, an adjustment to this provision will be required, at this time it reflects management's best estimate of the costs and settlement of claims.

As at 31 December 2024, the business restructuring and other provisions primarily includes dilapidation provisions for the primary care business. During the year the group released its provision related to acquisition tax matters other than income tax as the relevant tax years have closed for review.

Provisions as at 31 December 2024 are materially considered to be current and expected to be utilised at any time within the next twelve months, subject to external factors beyond the group's control.

| Trade and other payables        |  214   |  197.1 |

Accrued expenses includes general operating expenses incurred but not invoiced as at the year end, as well as holiday pay accrued of £2.1 million (2023: £2.1 million), and bonuses accrued during the year and paid during the following year of £5.3 million (2023: £12.7 million). Deferred income of £10.5 million relates to contract revenue of VHG.

Other payables include an accrual for pensions and payments on account. Revenue is not recognised in respect of payments on account until the performance obligation has been met at year end the balance of payments on account was £2.4 million (2023: £10.3 million). In addition other credit balances re-classed from trade debtors were £38.1 million (2023: £32.0 million), which largely relate to NHS credits. Payments on account are expected to be utilised against patient procedures within the following 12 months. The balance of payments on account as at 31 December 2023 were utilised in the current year when the patient attended the procedure, and not cancelling or deferring treatment, such payments on account could result in repayment to the patient should they request so.

Since the end of the financial year, the directors have proposed a final dividend of approximately 2.3 pence per share. The dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and is therefore not included in the balance sheet as a liability at 31 December 2024.

## 29. Share-based payments

The group operates a number of share-based payment schemes for executive directors and other employees, all of which are equity settled.

The group has no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle any of the options in cash. The total cost in respect of LTIPs and SAYE recognised in the income statement was £4.2 million in the year ended 31 December 2024 (2023: £3.7 million). Employer's national insurance is being accrued, where applicable, at the rate of 14.3%, which management expects to be the prevailing rate at the time the options are exercised, based on the share price at the reporting date. The total national insurance charge for the year was £0.5 million (2023: £0.4 million).

The following table analyses the total cost between each of the relevant schemes, together with the number of options outstanding:

A summary of the main features of the scheme is shown below:

## Long Term Incentive Plan

The Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) is open to executive directors and designated senior managers, and awards are made at the discretion of the remuneration committee. Awards are subject to market and non-market performance criteria.

Awards granted under the LTIP vest subject to achievement of performance conditions measured over a period of at least three years, unless the committee determines otherwise. Awards may be in the form of conditional share awards or nil-cost options or any other form allowed by the plan rules.

Vesting of awards will be dependent on a range of financial, operational or share price measures, as set by the committee, which are aligned with the long-term strategic objectives of the group and shareholder value creation. No less than 30% of an award will be based on share price measures. The remainder will be based on

## Long Term Incentive Plan continued

either financial and/or operational measures. At the threshold performance, no more than 25% of the award will vest, rising to 100% for maximum performance.

On 14 March 2022, the company granted a total of 3,097,060 options to the executive directors and other senior management.

## Deferred Share Bonus Plan

The Deferred Share Bonus Plan is a discretionary executive share bonus plan under which the remuneration committee determines that a proportion of a participant's annual bonus will be deferred. The market value of the shares granted to any employee will be equal to one-third of the total annual bonus that would otherwise have been payable to the individual. The awards will be granted on the day after the announcement of the group's annual results. The awards will normally vest over a three-year period.

## 31. Commitments

## Consignment stock

At 31 December 2024, the group held consignment stock on sale or return of £25.5 million (2023: £24.5 million). The group is only required to pay for the equipment it chooses to use and therefore this stock is not recognised as an asset.

Notes to financial statements continued

## 31. Commitments continued

## Capital commitments

Capital commitments comprise amounts payable under capital contracts which are duly authorised and in progress at the consolidated balance sheet date. They include the full cost of goods and services to be provided under the contracts through to completion. The group has rights within its contracts to terminate at short notice and, therefore, cancellation payments are minimal.

Capital commitments at the end of the year were as follows:

| (£m)                            |   2024 |   2023 |
|---------------------------------|--------|--------|
| Contracted but not provided for |   24.7 |   31.6 |

## 32. Financial guarantees

The group had the following guarantees at 31 December 2024:

- The bankers to Spire Healthcare Limited have issued a letter of credit in the maximum amount of £1.5 million (2023: £1.5 million) in relation to contractual pension obligations
- Under certain lease agreements entered into on 26 January 2010, the group has given undertakings relating to obligations in the lease documentation and the assets of the group are subject to a fixed and floating charge. See note C11 for details of financial guarantees in respect of lease arrangements and agreements.

## 33. Financial risk management and impairment of financial assets

The group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:

- Credit risk
- Liquidity risk
- Market risk

This note presents information about the group's exposure to each of the above risks, the group's objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these financial statements.

The directors have overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the group's risk management framework. The group's risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.

## Credit risk and impairment

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the group's receivables from customers and investment securities.

## Trade and other receivables

The group's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The group's exposure to credit risk from trade receivables is considered to be low because of the nature of its customers and policies in place to prevent credit risk occurring in normal circumstances.

Most revenues arise from insured patients' business and the NHS. Insured revenues give rise to trade receivables which are mainly due from large insurance institutions, which have high credit worthiness. The remainder of revenues arise from individual self-pay patients and consultants.

The group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its ECL in respect of trade and other receivables. This allowance is composed of specific losses that relate to individual exposures and also an ECL component established using rates reflecting historical information for payor groups, and forward looking information.

During the period, trade receivables have increased in line with revenue, but aged debt has reduced. Individual self-pay patients continues to be the largest risk for the group given the current economic uncertainty. The group has considered the provision required and maintained a provision accordingly through the expected loss rate percentages, which is in line with the position at December 2023. The Expected Credit Loss (ECL) as at year end is £6.2 million (2023: £5.5 million).

Note 19 shows the ageing and customer profiles of trade receivables outstanding at the year end.

Unbilled receivables are considered for expected credit losses, but these are not considered material and therefore not recognised.

## Investments

The group limits its exposure to credit risk by only investing in short-term money market deposits with large financial institutions, which must be rated at least Investment Grade by key rating agencies.

## Market risk

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as interest rates, will affect the group's income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.

## Interest rate risk

The group is exposed to interest rate risk arising from fluctuations in market rates. This affects future cash flows from money market investments and the cost of floating rate borrowings.

From time-to-time, the group considers the cost benefit of entering into derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate volatility based on existing variable rates, current and predicted interest yield curves and the cost of associated medium-term derivative financial instruments.

Interest rates on variable rate loans are determined by SONIA fixings on a quarterly basis. Interest is settled on all loans in line with agreements and is settled at least annually.

|                             | Variable   | Total   | Undrawn facility 1   |
|-----------------------------|------------|---------|----------------------|
| 31 December 2024 (£m)       | 365.0      | 365.0   | 60.0                 |
| Effective interest rate (%) | 5.85%      | 5.85%   |                      |
| 31 December 2023 (£m)       | 365.0      | 365.0   | 60.0                 |
| Effective interest rate (%) | 5.63%      | 5.63%   |                      |

1.  If this facility was drawn the interest rate would be in line with the variable rate loans.

The group has an interest rate swap derivative asset of £2.9 million (2023: £4.4 million liability) in place (refer to note 23).

The fair value of this instrument is considered the same as its carrying value and level two of the fair value hierarchy is used to measure the fair value of the instrument. The variable rate consideration received by the group is Sterling three month SONIA.

## 33. Financial risk management and impairment of financial assets continued Sensitivity analysis

A change of 25 basis points (bp) in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased/(decreased) equity and reported results by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.

## Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The group's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the group's reputation.

Liquidity is managed across the group and consideration is taken of the segregation of accounts for regulatory purposes. Short-term operational working capital requirements are met by cash in hand.

Typically the group ensures that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses for a period of at least 90 days, including the servicing of financial obligations. In addition to cash on demand, the group has available the following line of credit:

- £60.0 million of revolving credit facility, which was undrawn as at 31 December 2024 (2023: £60.0 million undrawn)

The following are contractual maturities, at as the balance sheet date, of financial liabilities, including interest payments and excluding the impact of netting agreements:

## Capital management

The group's objective is to maintain an appropriate balance of debt and equity financing to enable the group to continue as a going concern, to continue the future development of the business and to optimise returns to shareholders and benefits to other stakeholders.

The board closely manages trading capital, defined as net assets plus net debt. The group's net assets at 31 December 2024 were £746.2 million (2023: £737.8 million) and net debt, calculated as bank borrowings of £367.1 million (2023: £365.3 million) less cash and cash equivalents of £41.2 million (2023: £49.6 million) amounted to £325.9 million (2023: £315.7 million).

The principal focus of capital management revolves around working capital management and compliance with externally imposed financial covenants see note 23 for more detail.

Major investment decisions are based on reviewing the expected future cash flows and all major capital expenditure requires approval by the board.

At the balance sheet date, the group's committed undrawn facilities, and cash and cash equivalents were as follows:

| (£m)                                        |   2024 |   2023 |
|---------------------------------------------|--------|--------|
| Committed undrawn revolving credit facility |   60   |   60   |
| Cash and cash equivalents                   |   41.2 |   49.6 |

## Fair value measurement

As of 31 December 2024, except for an interest rate swap and financial asset relating to a gross profit share, the group did not hold financial instruments that are included in level 1, 2 or 3 of the hierarchy.

Management assessed that cash and short-term deposits, trade and other receivables, unbilled receivables, trade payables and other current liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. The carrying value of debt is approximately equal to its fair value. During the year ended 31 December 2024, there were no transfers between the levels in the fair value hierarchy.

In determining fair value measurement, the impact of potential climate-related matters, including legislation, which may affect the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities in the financial statements has been considered.

A derivative is a financial instrument whose value is based on one or more underlying variables. The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate risk. Derivatives are not held for speculative reasons. Fair values are obtained from market observable pricing information including interest rate yield curves and have been calculated as follows; fair value of interest rate swaps is determined as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves.

The financial asset reflects a profit share arrangement with a partner. There are no market observable prices for the valuation. Management therefore assesses forward looking information and appropriate discount rates and risk factors to determine the fair value. Sensitivities are also taken into account when reviewing the fair value (note 16).

During the year, Spire Healthcare received a profit share in respect of the financial asset of £1.0 million (2023: £0.8 million). In addition an unrealised fair value movement of £4.8 million (2023: £3.0 million) was recognised in income upon review of the financial asset to increase the value of the financial asset on the balance sheet.

As at 31 December 2023, the group held the following financial instruments measured at fair value:

## Cash flow hedge

The group designate, as cash flow hedges, interest rate swaps entered into with three counterparties maturing in February 2026. These interest rate swaps convert floating interest rate liabilities into fixed interest rate liabilities. The swaps run concurrently with the hedged item, being the group's floating rate liabilities under the senior finance facility. For the years ended December 2024 and 2023, there were no significant amounts recognised in the profit or loss relating to the ineffective portion of hedges or portions excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The movement in the interest rate swap relates to fair value movement and is recognised through other comprehensive income.

## Fair value hierarchy

The group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique:

Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly; and

Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.

The group recognised a total profit on disposals in the period of £4.5 million. The profit is reported within adjusting items (note 11). As part of the sale agreement the group has entered into a sub lease agreement with the trust to lease the Tunbridge Wells property. Included in the profit is £2.0 million relating to the derecognition of the right of use asset (£2.4 million) and recognition of the finance lease receivable (£4.4 million).

## Notes to the parent company financial statements

For the year ended 31 December 2024

This section contains the notes to the company financial statements. The issued share capital and EBT share reserves are consistent with the Spire Healthcare Group plc group financial statements. Refer to note 22 of the group financial statements.

## C1. Basis of preparation

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted International Accounting Standards (IAS) in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and on an historical cost basis. The financial statements are presented in UK sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest million pounds (£m), except when otherwise indicated.

See note 1 for general information about the company.

The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as the directors believe there are no material uncertainties that lead to significant doubt that the company can continue as a going concern until June 2026 (see the going concern section in note 2 for more detail).

The company applies consistent accounting policies, as applied by the group. To the extent that an accounting policy is relevant to both group and company financial statements, refer to the group financial statements for disclosure of the accounting policy. Material policies that apply to the company only are included as appropriate.

The company has used the exemption granted under s408 of the Companies Act 2006 that allows for the non-disclosure of the income statement of the parent company.

The company did not have items to be reported as other comprehensive income; therefore, no statement of comprehensive income was prepared.

## C2. Significant accounting policies in this section

## Investment in subsidiary

The company's investment in subsidiary is carried at cost less provisions resulting from impairment. In testing for impairment, the carrying value of the investment is compared to its recoverable amount, being its value-in-use. In addition, market capitalisation is compared to the investments of the company when assessing impairment requirements.

## Share-based payments

The financial effect of awards by the company of options over its equity shares to employees of subsidiary undertakings is recognised by the company in its individual financial statements as an increase in its investment in subsidiaries with a credit to equity equivalent to the IFRS 2 cost in subsidiary undertakings. The subsidiary, in turn, will recognise the IFRS 2 cost in its income statement with a credit to equity to reflect the deemed capital contribution from the company.

## C3. Other areas of accounting estimates in this section

## Impairment testing of investment in subsidiary

The market capitalisation of the company is compared to the investment of the company to determine if there is a trigger for impairment review. Management acknowledged indicators of impairment at the year end, being, the net assets of the company are higher than that of the group's consolidated net assets and that the market capitalisation exceeds the investment value including intercompany receivables. The company's investment in its subsidiary has been tested for impairment by comparison against the underlying value of the subsidiary's assets, based on value-in-use calculated using the same assumptions as noted for the testing of goodwill impairment in note 15 of the group financial statements adjusted for the assumption that internal and external borrowings including lease liabilities have been settled. See note C9 for more detail.

Details of the company's subsidiaries at the balance sheet date are in note 17 to the group financial statements.

At the year end, the investment in subsidiary were reviewed for indicators of impairment.

Management acknowledged indicators of impairment at the year end, being, the net assets of the company are higher than that of the group's consolidated net assets and that the market capitalisation exceeds the investment value including intercompany receivables.

The recoverable amount of the investment is calculated by reference to its estimated value-in-use calculation adjusted for the assumption that internal and external borrowings including lease liabilities have been settled.

In order to estimate the value-in-use, management has used trading projections covering the period to December 2029 from the most recent board approved budget. The variables in the cash flows are interdependent and reflect management's expectations based on past experience and current market trends, it takes into account both current business and committed initiatives. In addition, management consider the potential financial impact from short-term climate change scenarios, and the cost of initiatives by the group to manage the longer-term climate impacts.

Management determined that no impairment was required as the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount by £623.3 million.

## Key assumptions

Management identified a number of key assumptions relevant to the value-in-use calculation, being EBITDA growth over the five-year period, capital maintenance spend, discount rate and the long-term growth rate. The assumptions are based on past experience and external sources of information.

The trading projections for the five-year period underlying the value in use reflect a growth in EBITDA. EBITDA is dependent on a number of elements of the operating model over the longer term, including pricing trends, volume growth and the mix and complexity of procedures and assumptions regarding cost inflation. The average annual EBITDA growth over the five years is 10.7%.

During the 2023 financial year, the group moved to a post IFRS 16 discount rate, and has used a pre-tax discount rate of 11.2% (2023: 11.5%).

## Notes to the parent company financial statements continued

## C9. Investment in subsidiary continued

## Key assumptions continued

A long-term growth rate of 2.0% has been applied to cash flows beyond 2029 based on long term view of inflation and market conditions. Capital maintenance spend is based on historic run rates and our expectation of the group's requirements.

Management has performed a sensitivity analysis using reasonably possible changes for each key assumption, keeping all other assumptions constant. The sensitivity analysis included an assessment of the break-even point for each of the key assumptions. The sensitivity testing identified no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions that would cause the carrying amount of the investment to exceed its recoverable amount.

## C10. Capital management and financial instruments

The capital structure of the company comprises issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the company statement of changes in equity totalling £1,302.5 million as at 31 December 2024 (2023: £1,237.5 million), and cash amounted to £0.1 million (2023: £0.1 million).

## Credit risk

As at 31 December 2024, the company had amounts owed by subsidiary undertakings of £475.0 million (2023: £406.7 million). The company's maximum exposure to credit risk from these amounts is £475.0 million (2023: £406.7 million).

## Liquidity risk

The company finances its activities through its investments in subsidiary undertakings.

The company anticipates that its funding sources will be sufficient to meet its anticipated future administrative expenses and dividend obligations as they become due over the next 12 months.

Dividends paid in the year:

| (£m)                                                                     |   2024 |   2023 |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|
| Final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2023 (2.1 pence per share) |    8.5 |      2 |
| Total dividends paid                                                     |    8.5 |      2 |

Since the end of the financial year, the directors have proposed a final dividend of approximately 2.3 pence per share. The dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and is therefore not included in the balance sheet as a liability at 31 December 2024.

| (£m)                                              | 2024   | 2023   |

The above financial assets are not impaired.

| (£m)                                                   | 2024   | 2023   |

| Amounts owed to subsidiary undertakings                | 8.8    | -      |
|                                                        | 8.8    | -      |

All of the above financial liabilities have a maturity of less than one year.

The fair value of financial assets and liabilities approximates their carrying value.

## Market risk

## Interest rate risk and sensitivity analysis

As at 31 December 2024 the company had short-term borrowings of £8.8 million (2023: Nil) owed to subsidiary undertakings, which are repayable on demand and bear interest at SONIA plus 2.05% (2023: SONIA plus 2.05%). Interest on these borrowings in the year amounted to Nil (2023: Nil) and the directors do not perceive that servicing this debt poses any significant risk to the company given its size in relation to the company's net assets.

IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures required a market risk sensitivity analysis illustrating the fair values of the company's financial instruments and the impact on the company's income statement and shareholders' equity of reasonably possible changes in selected market risks. Excluding cash and cash equivalents, the company has no financial assets or liabilities that expose it to market risk, other than the amounts owed by/to subsidiary undertakings of £475.0 million (2023: £406.7 million) and £8.8 million (2023: Nil) respectively. The directors do not believe that a change of 25 basis points in the SONIA interest rates will have a material impact on the company's income statement or shareholders' equity.

## C11. Financial guarantees

The below financial guarantees have been assessed in line with the requirements of IFRS 17 insurance contracts and are exempt as the guarantees have not been asserted explicitly as insurance contracts and as such the accounting for insurance contracts is not applicable.

## Lease arrangements with a consortium of investors

The company has given a guarantee to a consortium of investors, comprising Malaysia's Employees Provident Fund (EPF), affiliated funds of Och-Ziff Capital Management group and Moor Park Capital, in relation to the sale of 12 of the Spire Healthcare group's property-owning companies on 17 January 2013. With effect from 17 January 2013, the total third-party annual commitments of the group under these leases increased by £51.3 million per annum.

As a result of the sale, the group has long-term institutional lease arrangements (up to December 2042, subject to renewal or extension), with the landlord for each of the 12 properties. The leases include key terms such as annual rental covenants and minimum levels of capital expenditure invested by the group. The capital expenditure covenants measured on an average basis over each five-year period during the term of the leases, require the group to incur, in total, £5.0 million of maintenance capital expenditure and £3.0 million of additional capital expenditure on the portfolio of 12 hospitals each year, such being subject to indexation in line with RPI. If the minimum rent cover ratio is not met, the group is required to enter into an asset performance recovery plan in order to comply with the covenants, but no default would be deemed to have occurred. The company is a party to this guarantee. As at 31 December 2024 the group complied with the required covenants and the lease liability held on the consolidated balance sheet is £645.0 million (2023: £628.7 million).

Based on the liquidity and expected cash generation of Spire Healthcare Limited, the expected credit loss in respect of these financial guarantees, as at 31 December 2024, is not considered to be significant. As a result, no liability has been recorded (2023: Nil).

## Lease agreements entered into by Classic Hospitals Limited (novated to Spire Healthcare Limited)

Under lease agreements entered into on 26 January 2010 by Classic Hospitals Limited, a subsidiary undertaking of the company, the company has undertaken to guarantee the payment of rentals over the lease term to August 2040, and to ensure that the other covenants in the lease are observed. The lease has been moved to Spire Healthcare Limited, another subsidiary undertaking of the company, to allow Classic Hospitals Limited to enter Members' Voluntary Liquidation as part of the entity rationalisation carried out during the 2021 financial year. The initial rentals payable under the leases in 2010 were £6.3 million per annum, which will be subject to an increase in future years. As part of these arrangements, the assets of the company are subject to a fixed and floating charge in the event of a default. As at 31 December 2024, there was no breach in the required covenants and the lease liability held on the Consolidated balance sheet is £81.2 million (2023: £81.2million).

Based on the liquidity and expected cash generation of Spire Healthcare Limited, the expected credit loss in respect of these financial guarantees, as at 31 December 2024, is not considered to be significant. As a result, no liability has been recorded (2023: Nil).

There are no implications for Capital Gains Tax purposes (no gain or loss) on gifts of shares to charity and it is also possible to obtain income tax relief.

Shareholder information continued

## Shareholder security

From time-to-time, in common with other listed companies, shareholders may receive unsolicited phone calls or correspondence concerning investment matters. These are typically from overseas-based 'brokers' who target UK shareholders, using persuasive and high-pressure tactics to lure investors into scams in what often turn out to be worthless, non-existent or high-risk shares in US or UK investments. These operations are commonly known as 'boiler rooms'.

Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free company reports. Further information on how to avoid share fraud or to report a scam can be found on our website at www.spirehealthcare.com.
