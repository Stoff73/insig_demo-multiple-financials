## The STV Investor Proposition

STV has a clear strategy, which is understood and embedded across the organisation, to grow our Digital and Studios businesses to take advantage of the accelerating market in global video, while maximising the value of our linear Broadcast channel and the market-leading advertising platform it represents.

### Our clearly focused strategy is shifting the balance of earnings towards digital and IP

This clearly focused strategy is shifting the balance of earnings towards digital and IP, driving a higher quality of earnings and is therefore key to generating sustainable value for our shareholders.

Since 2018, we have successfully rebalanced our business, investing in content and selling non-core assets, and exceeded our target to generate more than 50% of our operating profit from Digital and Studios by the end of 2023.
