## Chairman's Statement

**Paul Reynolds, Chairman**

2024 was another challenging year for the media industry with international and domestic economic uncertainty and a cautious commissioning market, which flowed through to tough markets for advertising and new content creation. STV is stronger and more resilient than ever, so we responded well, although we had our own particular changes to manage with the news that our CEO was moving on, and a Board roster up for significant refresh.

### Performance

Revenue outcome for the year was £188m (2023: £168m) with adjusted operating profit of £20.6m (2023: £20.1m). More details are included in the Finance Review on pages 30 to 32.

Performance was helped in H1 by the Euros football tournament delivering strong audience and advertising numbers, but H2 was much more subdued due to the UK's General Election and the new Government's first Budget. There were also tough prior year comparators in Q4, which benefitted from the Rugby World Cup in 2023. As a result, our financial performance was more evenly split across H1/H2 than has been the case previously. Notwithstanding this macro backdrop, we continued to make progress in the delivery of our strategic plan through focusing on key creative labels in Studios, developing partnerships in Digital through the Premier Sports tie-in, staying close to our Scottish advertisers, and shaping our organisation for the future.

### Strategy

Our strategy over the past few years has laid strong foundations for growth and in March 2024 we set out the next phase of STV's transformation. Refreshed strategic objectives for the business are focused around the pillars of Content, Audience, Monetisation and Organisation. We are making good progress against the ambitious 3-year strategy and the new targets and KPIs that underpin it.

#### Content
Our growing scale has delivered 51 new commissions or recommissions in what has been a very difficult market in 2024. We completed the integration of Greenbird Media, acquired in July 2023, and reviewed the creative labels in our expanded portfolio to ensure a focus on those with the highest potential to create returnable formats with international appeal.

We increased our minority stakes to a majority in drama producers Two Cities, factual format producers Hello Halo and entertainment label Rumpus Media; and increased stakes in unscripted specialists Tuesday's Child and Crackit TV. We also parted company with four labels, taking the overall number of labels in the STV Studios portfolio to 21.

#### Audience
Broadcast TV channels and their streaming services – such as STV and STV Player – still dominate video viewing, despite the attention given to new streaming competitors. Therefore, the news that STV has renewed its Channel 3 licences for a further 10 years to 2034 is welcome and I am delighted that STV remained Scotland's dominant commercial channel in 2024. STV Player also continued its growth trajectory, with active registered users up and registrations to subscription service, STV Player+, also increasing.

#### Monetisation
We are proud of our leading commercial offer for advertisers: a one-stop-shop for brands combining the unrivalled mass reach of national advertising, with our uniquely powerful local advertising platform for Scottish SMEs, and a highly targeted digital advertising capability via STV Player.

#### Organisation
We are modernising and simplifying our business for a digital world and controlling our cost base, on track to deliver savings of £5m p.a. by the end of 2026.

### Culture

One responsibility of the Board is to make sure we have a positive workplace culture and empower our people to make a difference, so we continue to invest in talent and drive a culture of belonging.

The Board also gives priority to STV's social impact, which includes our STV Zero strategy, and embedding our inclusion priorities – both on and off screen. Through the STV Children's Appeal we use our reach to shine a light on the issue of child poverty in Scotland and, with our partners, raised £2.4m this year for projects across Scotland.

### Governance and Board Operations

There were some changes to the Board during the year with three Directors stepping down, giving us the opportunity to welcome new talent.

We announced in March 2024 that Simon Pitts intended to step down as Chief Executive and he left the business on 31 October 2024. Following a very thorough selection process, the Board was delighted to appoint Rufus Radcliffe as Chief Executive from 1 November 2024.

The Board recognised the broadening of Lindsay Dixon's role and increased responsibilities, and in April 2024 she was promoted to an expanded role of Chief Financial & Operating Officer.

### Dividend

The Board places great emphasis on generating returns for our shareholders. The Board proposes a final ordinary dividend of 7.4p per share, which, when added to the interim dividend, provides a total dividend for the year of 11.3p per share in line with 2023.

### Looking to the Future

Whilst the current challenging macro-economic conditions continue to be difficult for consumers and businesses alike, I and my fellow Board members are very positive that STV is well-placed to make good progress in the years ahead.
