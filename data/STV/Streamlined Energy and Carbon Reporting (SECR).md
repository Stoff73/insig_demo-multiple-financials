### Emissions Targets

Medium term targets for combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions to the end of 2025 were set in 2022, using 2019 as a baseline. On a like for like basis, in 2024 a reduction of 73.6% (equivalent to 884 tCO2) was achieved. This decrease was driven by the transition to renewable energy at the office locations where we directly control energy supply. The target for the end of 2025 is to reduce emissions by 841 tCO2; the equivalent of a 72.1% reduction on 2019 levels.
