### Strategy

The Group has identified several climate-related risks and opportunities over the short, medium and long term. In assessing the significance of each it has defined 'materiality' as an impact on the business that limits our ability to carry out our operations, and/or requires a change to our business model, and/or has a significant impact on our liquidity thereby limiting our ability to invest or meet obligations as they fall due.

**Time horizons:**
- Short term: next financial year (2025)
- Medium term: period of our Group 3 Year Plan (through to the end of 2027)
- Long term: from 2028 to 2030

### Risk Management

The identification, assessment and management of climate-related risks and opportunities is undertaken throughout the business, with subsidiary/divisional management teams responsible for these activities in their own business and then the Management Board, ESG Committee and Board of Directors taking a Group-wide perspective.

### Metrics and Targets

**GHG emissions**
STV reports its GHG inventory breakdown as well as its emissions intensity. STV Zero sets out our emissions reduction targets.

**Transition**
For an overview of metrics and targets in relation to our net zero carbon strategy, STV Zero, refer to pages 56 to 67. We measure the number of programmes produced by STV News and STV Studios (separately) that achieve albert accreditation. Our target is to achieve 100%.

In FY24, we achieved 100% of all programming from both STV News and STV Studios, with 100% being achieved in FY23.
