## A View from the STV Executive

### Q&A with Rufus Radcliffe (Chief Executive) and Lindsay Dixon (Chief Financial & Operating Officer)

**How would you summarise 2024 for STV Group plc?**

**Lindsay:** We delivered a good result in a very challenging market. The strong first half was shaped by the brilliant advertising and viewing performance delivered by the Euros, with the second half being tougher as we moved through a period of UK government change, the first Labour Budget, and strong comparators in Q4 with the Rugby World Cup in 2023.

Group revenue and adjusted operating profit were in line with our expectations, and the future remains supported by a strong orderbook in Studios. Costs and cash continue to be well-controlled in a world of many headwinds and we have just secured a new revolving credit facility that will provide the liquidity and flexibility to support the next phase of business growth.

**Rufus:** The foundations of the business are strong and there's real growth potential which we're actively exploring. I've been struck by the passion and commitment of my new colleagues, the brand strength in Scotland and connection with viewers and advertisers, and the sizeable international prospects of the Studios business.

**2023 saw the major acquisition of Greenbird Media. What impact has this had on the business through 2024?**

**Lindsay:** This acquisition brought talent, scale and enhanced international potential to STV. It's generating a return on invested capital in line with the acquisition business case, which is particularly pleasing given the continuing tough commissioning market.

**Rufus:** Our new labels have had some impressive wins in 2024. Tuesday's Child's The Fortune Hotel won a second series from ITV; Hello Halo secured an original new format, Game of Wool, for Channel 4; and Crackit TV won two original formats from Channel 4 and Channel 5 – to name a few.

**What have been the key challenges in 2024 and how have you addressed those?**

**Lindsay:** The key challenge of 2024 has been the macro-economic backdrop combined with the unsettling effect of political change in the UK – and internationally – which have impacted consumer confidence and commissioning budgets alike.

We've worked hard to limit the impact of these factors on the business. We've maximised opportunities around key content and moments in the schedule and developed creative solutions for brands. Our acquisition strategy in Studios has allowed us to spread our bets, with 51 commissions won in 2024, including valuable drama series.

**What progress has been made across ESG?**

**Lindsay:** These activities are an integral part of how we do business. Whether that's raising awareness of sustainable lifestyles during 'Sustainable Scotland Week' on STV or creating an inclusive culture for colleagues to thrive, or giving back through the STV Appeal, our ESG targets ensure continued focus on the creation of long-term value.

With 12 of 14 sustainability targets achieved in 2024, we've also prioritised emissions monitoring to enhance disclosure and reporting.

**How will you deliver value for shareholders in 2025?**

**Rufus:** I'm working closely with the team on a refreshed strategy for the business, which we'll share in May 2025. Priorities will be continued growth momentum and international ambition, the exploration of new revenue opportunities and partnership working, and the delivery of exceptional content.
