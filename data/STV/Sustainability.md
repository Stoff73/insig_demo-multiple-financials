## Sustainability

Progress has been achieved against all of our 2024 targets as we reduce the carbon impact of our business and encourage colleagues to work in more sustainable ways, becoming an increasingly environmentally conscious organisation. As targets for 2024 have been delivered, new commitments building on this progress have been introduced to ensure further progress in 2025 and beyond.
