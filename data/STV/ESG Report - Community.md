## ESG Report

### Community

**In 2024, we raised over £2.4m to provide essential support to children and families in Scotland.**

In 2024, the price of essentials such as food, housing and energy increased, leaving many families struggling to make ends meet. With inflation projected to remain above recent norms into 2025, the effects of poverty are being felt far and wide across Scotland. Through its commitment to help children and families that need it most in Scotland, the STV Children's Appeal funded multiple projects that provide essential support around material need, education and employability, wellbeing and community.

### Fundraising Activity

This year saw a variety of fundraising activity across established events, new ventures and partnerships that raised awareness of the Appeal and its mission, helping to raise over £2.4 million.

Hundreds of people took on the Kiltwalk for the STV Children's Appeal across all four events in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen, raising thousands of pounds that will be distributed to local charities.

The Big Scottish Breakfast – run in partnership with Kellogg's – launched in May and ran for a week in September, with groups, businesses and schools hosting their own breakfast events to raise funds for the Appeal. The Big Scottish Breakfast was supported by celebrities Anton Danyluk and Jean Johansson, as well as STV weather presenter Sean Batty. The Appeal also engaged several influencers, including Andy the Highlander, the Halal Gal, and Scotland Uncovered, who collaborated on videos to raise awareness of the campaign. This led to our highest ever social engagement for the campaign and over 100 events being held across Scotland. Funds raised from the campaign will help support projects that provide free breakfast for children and young people at risk of hunger across Scotland.

June saw the return of the STV Appeal Cup for its third year. The tournament was hosted at Powerleague Glasgow with companies such as Dell, Envevo, Arnold Clark and KPMG battling it out for the winning trophy. The STV Appeal Golf Day entered its second year and grew in size as a sold-out event with 22 teams taking part. And the Big Brunch returned in Glasgow, as well as making its debut in Aberdeen, bringing people from across the North East together for an afternoon of fun and fundraising.

### Who We Help

The STV Children's Appeal is a grant-making charity committed to helping children and families across Scotland, by funding projects that provide essential support.

The Appeal funds both national and local projects across Scotland. This includes Street Soccer Scotland, who used their grant to extend their reach. They opened an additional base in Aberdeen to provide free football to children aged 10-16 and adults of all ages to drive social inclusion. The charity also increased their women-only sessions with the support of female staff and have seen a huge increase of players from a refugee background.

The Appeal partnered with The Corra Foundation to launch the Boost small grants programme. Boost funding was available for organisations supporting children and families in their local communities, and was created to help groups whose important work was impacted by increases in basic running costs such as utilities, salaries and transport.

Another charity that benefitted from Appeal funding was Saheliya, a specialist mental health and wellbeing support organisation for black, minority ethnic, asylum seeker, refugee and migrant women and girls. This funding enabled Saheliya to increase their capacity to provide case work advocacy and language support for women in Glasgow and Edinburgh.

### Programming

As Scotland's commercial Public Service Broadcaster, STV is dedicated to providing a platform to raise awareness of the profound impact of child poverty and highlight the vital work of charities across Scotland striving to break down barriers and give children the best possible start in life. STV also aims to inspire viewers by showcasing how their support and fundraising efforts can make a meaningful difference.

The STV Children's Appeal campaign culminated with two key programmes shown in November. Jean Johansson hosted documentary STV Children's Appeal: The Game Changers which explored the power of role models in changing lives. The programme shone a light on three charities which have mentorship at the heart of their work: Haus of Seisay in Paisley, Scran Academy in Edinburgh, and Dundee Dragons. It highlighted the importance of community and relationships in helping young people overcome adversity and finding a path towards a brighter future.

The year's fundraising was celebrated in The STV Children's Appeal 2024 with Appeal Trustee, Lorraine Kelly, and STV's Entertainment Reporter Laura Boyd for a lively show filmed at Glasgow Kelvin College. The show highlighted the charity work taking place across Scotland and celebrated fundraising heroes and ambassadors. Featured in the 30-minute show were Laura Boyd and Sean Batty's Landmark Challenge, charities East Lothian Young Carers, Bairnecessities and Lesley Community Pantry, and a variety of fundraising activities.

Children from St Andrews RC Secondary School hosted a weeklong 'channel takeover' on STV, replacing the usual continuity announcers to introduce shows like The Chase, Emmerdale, and The STV Children's Appeal Show and documentary. These clips were shown on STV alongside celebrity donation messages from Brian Cox, Marli Siu and Alan Cumming among others.

The channel also aired spotlights on key charity partners such as Lidl, Beatson's, Tunnock's and Arnold Clark who supported the Appeal in their own unique way.
