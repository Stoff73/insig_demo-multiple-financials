## In our opinion the financial statements:

- give a true and fair view of the state of the Group's and of the Parent Company's affairs as at 31 March 2024 and of the Group's loss for the period then ended;
- have been properly prepared in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standards;
- have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

## Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group and Parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

## Material uncertainty related to going concern

We draw attention to note 2.5 in the financial statements and the going concern paragraphs in the Strategic Report on page 9 which explains that that the Board has considered the potential shortfall in funding over the following 12 months from date of approval of these financial statements.

The Board acknowledge their expectation that further working capital is required to support the Group and parent company's over both the short and potentially medium term. In addition to this there are also inherent uncertainties over future projected revenue growth including the timing of the receipt for significant research and development claims. Together the above indicates a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the Group and parent company's ability to continue as a going concern. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the directors' assessment of the Group and parent company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:

- Discussions with management with regards to future funding requirements;
- Examining the directors' going concern assessment including the worst-case scenario cash flow forecast that covers at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements;
- Assessing the cash flow requirements of the Group and parent company based on budgets and projections;
- Understanding what forecast expenditure is committed and what could be considered discretionary;
- Considering the liquidity of existing assets in the statement of financial position;
- Considering the options available to management for further fundraising, or additional sources of finance;
- Making enquiries of management of their knowledge of events or conditions beyond 12 months which would give rise to further uncertainties, and
- Evaluating the reliability of the data underpinning the projections covering 12 months from expected date of approval of the financial statements along with the numerical accuracy of the calculations; and
- considering the accuracy of past budgeting and trading history, as well as a review of the July 2024 management accounts compared to forecast.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.
