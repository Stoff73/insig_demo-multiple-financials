## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

## Remuneration Committee

The Remuneration Committee is comprised of the executive and non-executive Directors and was chaired by Richard Bernstein during the year ended 31 March 2024, after John Murray's passing. Its primary responsibility is to set the level of remuneration for both Directors and Key management personnel, determining terms and conditions of service, including the grant of share options, having due regard to the interests of shareholders.

## Nominations Committee

The Board has agreed that appointments to the Board will be made by the Board as a whole and so has not created a Nominations Committee.

## Non-Executive Directors

The Board has adopted guidelines for the appointment of Non-Executive Directors which have been in place and which have been observed throughout the year. These provide for the orderly and constructive succession and rotation of the Chairman and non-executive Directors insofar as both the Chairman and non-executive Directors will be appointed for an initial term of three years and may, at the Board's discretion believing it to be in the best interests of the Company, be appointed for subsequent terms. The Chairman may serve as a Non-Executive Director before commencing a first term as Chairman. In accordance with the Companies Act 2006, the Board complies with: a duty to act within their powers; a duty to promote the success of the Company; a duty to exercise independent judgement; a duty to exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence; a duty to avoid conflicts of interest; a duty not to accept benefits from third parties and a duty to declare any interest in a proposed transaction or arrangement.

## Principle T en

Shareholder Communication

Aside from the distribution to shareholders of an Annual Report and an Interim Report at the half year, shareholders are invited to attend an annual general meeting each year and other meetings where their input and approval is required.

The Company encourages two-way communication with both its institutional and private investors and responds quickly to all queries received. The Chairman is available to the Group's major shareholders and ensures that their views are communicated fully to the Board.

The Board recognises the Annual General Meeting as an important opportunity to meet private shareholders. The Directors are available to listen to the views of shareholders informally immediately following the Annual General Meeting.

The Company will disclose outcomes of all votes at general meetings of shareholders in a clear and transparent manner either on the website or via an announcement.

Where a significant proportion of votes (20% of independent votes) have been cast against a resolution at any general meeting, the Company will provide an explanation of what actions it intends to take to understand the reasons behind that vote result, and, where appropriate, any different action it has taken, or will take, as a result of the vote.

Insig AI's website is regularly updated for regulatory announcements and other required information and is accessible online at: https://insig.ai/investors/

The Board has ultimate responsibility for reviewing and approving the Annual Report and Financial Statements and it has considered and endorsed the arrangements for their preparation, under the guidance of its Audit and Risk Committee.
