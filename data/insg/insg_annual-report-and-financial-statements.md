## CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S REPORT

## Dear Shareholders,

It is now three months since I became Chief Executive. I am also delighted that John Wilson has become Chairman. Set out below is my assessment of the performance of the business during the year ended 31 March 2024, together with an update on recent progress and of prospects. First, let me turn to the year ended 31 March 2024.

## Financial headlines

In summary, we are reporting an operating loss before non-cash impairments of intangible assets of £2.2 million. This compares with an operating loss prior to impairment for the previous year of £4.8 million. Within the loss for the year, the non-cash expense of depreciation and amortisation was £1.6 million, resulting in an operating loss of £0.6 million prior to these non-cash charges. The equivalent loss for the previous year was £2.0 million.

Revenues for the year were £0.4 million as against £0.7 million in the year to March 2023.

The financial results reflect not only trading but some accounting standard led treatments of intangible assets, and loan notes which have a distorting impact on the optics of the results in my view. As I set out below, the financial year ended 31 March 2024 as well as the current financial year to date, represents a period of progress, right-sizing of the business and pleasingly, significantly improved relationships with several hopefully long term and significant prospective partners of Insig. Frustratingly however, these developing relationships did not yield significant revenues in the financial year ended 31 March 2024.

Following the conversion of £0.75 million of loan notes into equity, outstanding convertible loan notes reduced from £2.3 million to £1.5 million as at 31 March 2024.

## Disposal of Sports in Schools Limited and The Elms Group Limited

Sports in Schools and Elms Group combined generated a profit before tax of approximately £210,085 (2023: £19,000). In November 2023, the Company's 85.87% owned subsidiary, Pantheon Leisure plc ("Pantheon"), entered into a sale agreement for Sports in Schools and Elms Group with Haygreen Limited for a total cash consideration payable of £0.3 million (the "Cash Consideration"). The joint profit before tax for Sport in Schools and Elms Group up to November 2023 was.

The directors of Pantheon Leisure plc, which previously held the Group's interest in Sports in Schools, have decided to proceed with striking off the company. The company no longer conducts any form of trade, has no recoverable assets or funds. Therefore, the Directors believe it appropriate to apply for strike off under s1003 of the Companies Act 2006. The Directors consider that the strike off proposal is in the best interests of the Company and its Shareholders as a whole. This will result in a reduction in legal and administrative costs.

In November 2023, I agreed to release security over my loan of £0.75 million to the Company and I converted the loan plus accumulated interest into 3,925,380 ordinary shares at 20p per share.

## Successful equity funding

In April 2023, the Company announced that it had completed an equity subscription raising £0.9 million at 17p per share, and as part of which, I subscribed for £0.15 million.

Post period end, in April and May 2024, I subscribed to the Company for 1,250,000 shares at 20p. In June 2024, the Company successfully raised £0.81 million at 12.5p per share, with NR Holdings Limited becoming a new shareholder.

## The report card for the year to 31 March 2024

In the first few months of the year under review, much of our resources were focussed on our data and technology collaboration agreement, working with the Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA"). In April 2023, we announced that we would be providing the data and software platforms to the FCA's 2023 TechSprint, known as the Global Financial Innovation Network's (GFIN) Greenwashing TechSprint. The GFIN Greenwashing TechSprint brought together 13 international regulators.

The goal of the project was to develop a tool or solution to help regulators tackle or mitigate the risks of greenwashing in financial services across the globe. The project focused on how technology, including AI and Machine Learning, can enable regulators and supervisors to verify that ESG-related product claims are accurate and complete and how technology can help monitor, collate, and identify examples of greenwashing.

Insig AI provided our data and technology platform for onboarding of partners and participants of the GFIN Greenwashing TechSprint. The core data set comprised our database of pdf and machine-readable corporate financial and ESG documents with entity mapping and sentence-level classification against 15 ESG issues.

Our endeavour was recognised last September, when the FCA publicly referred to Insig AI as a key contributor.

## CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S REPORT

In October 2023, we announced the launch of The Transparency and Disclosure Index ("TDI"). Using evidence-based analysis of more than 200 million machine readable sentences from our corporate disclosure document repository, the TDI demonstrates what stakeholders and market participants require: how well a company is disclosing non-financial information and how transparent it is. Scoring highlights gaps that are actionable for each company to remedy.

The TDI framework is based on best practice principles behind the convergence of reporting standards. Reports are compared to best practice, benchmarking against peer groups, measuring website clarity and accessibility of documents. It highlights where the range of sustainability documents is considered excessive and flags where companies may be over-using certain keywords identified as being commonly used in greenwashing without evidence and are possibly misleading. Using our search tools and our machine learning database, users can perform a deep dive into every aspect of a multitude of disclosures. Whist the TDI is not seeking to accuse any company, in 2022, both Signature Bank and Home REIT were flagging material issues in terms of very poor transparency and disclosure.

Despite the Company's engagement with the FCA and launching of the Transparency and Disclosure Index, these efforts failed to translate into new business wins. As Chief Executive, my immediate priority on appointment was to identify why this was the case and to then implement the changes required to be able to translate efforts into commercial success.

In mitigation, there can be no doubt that over the last two years, the UK asset management industry has experienced a 'bear market,' with fund outflows and consequential budgetary pressures. Against this backdrop, investment decisions, particularly in new solutions, has become a casualty. Secondly, until there is regulation in place that requires certain compliance, there is no compelling event that necessitates a spend.

There have however, been some encouraging indicators recently that the UK asset management industry is beginning to recover and that this will result in an easing of budgetary constraints. Of more importance though is that from January 2025, for EU companies with more than 250 employees, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) comes into force. Penalties for non-compliance include fines (in Germany up to 5% of turnover) and prison sentences for directors of up to five years. In the UK, the FCA's anti-greenwashing rules are already in force. In the US, climate related risk disclosures come into effect in January 2025.

It might be easy to attribute the lack of new business wins to the 'bear market' and the delay in regulation. It is my assessment, this would not be accurate. 'The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars but in ourselves,' springs to mind. For too long, the business was engaging with people who were not authorised to make the spending decision. Furthermore, we could have been articulated the offering in a way that showed the benefits to prospective customers in my opinion and we could also have contacted a greater quantity of prospects. All these issues have now been identified: we are establishing clear measurable deliverables and setting specific timelines and performance reviews to monitor progress. Conversations with prospects are now focused solely on the benefit to that prospect, rather than how clever the technology is. Delivering on the core goals of the business is now fundamental. There will be further enhancements in the coming weeks and months, including improved marketing and new partnerships that can bring revenues by making available our products and services to new markets.

## Where we are today

Let me set out what Insig AI has to offer. There are two distinct parts of the business. Firstly, a vast repository of corporate reports that enables regulators, corporates, asset managers and all market participants to access, interrogate and compare disclosures within and between companies. Our database uses the best of machine learning and AI tools in this area. Secondly, our ability to provide fast, accessible AI-ready data. Asset managers can gain insights into their holdings, manage risk and increase alpha. Insig AI can structure and centralise data making it secure whilst increasing the efficiency and productivity.

When I was appointed Chief Executive, I commented that sales cycles to large corporates for emerging technologies can take up to 18 months. This remains the case. The business is in detailed discussions with several prospects and given that our offering involves AI, in some cases, we are being told that the decision-making process involves multiple parties within an organisation.

Some of these discussions include a number of the Big 4 Accounting Practices. In the case of one of those firms, we have invested significant resources, including partcipating in a workshop with FTSE100 companies and been introduced as this firm's 'AI partner' . Our offering is able to benefit this firm's top line as well as reducing regulatory risk to many of its clients. Our solutions ought to be a 'no brainer' . Feedback has been very positive. However, procurement processes in these huge enterprises are extraordinarly lengthy and complex and lack the sense of urgency that we would expect. Whilst these timelines are incredibly frustrating, on success, they should convert into material, long-term substantial revenues.

## CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S REPORT

## Prospects

For the current year, we continue to expect to grow revenues. As importantly, we are working to convert ongoing discussions with potential strategic partners into commercial agreements that will enable their customers to access our machine learning capabilities.

Amongst these, we are now engaging with three of the 'Big 4' Accounting Practices. We are also now in discussions with one of the 'Big 3' Management Consultancy firms. Separately, we have been approached by one of the UK's largest financial PR advisors to assist in advising clients to comply with the new Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive.

We are in dialogue with a UK asset manager with assets under management of more than £2 billion, with a view to partnering on a new fund launch. On the data science side, we are expecting to win a long-term contract with an asset manager who has indicated that it wants to work with us to improve its structured data as it rapidly expands and wins new mandates.

As Insig AI's largest shareholder and someone who has a track record of 'skin in the game' in effecting positive change and delivering for stakeholders, I am as keen as any shareholder to report on tangible positive results as soon as possible. Operating in a hitherto nascent market has required patience.

Whether you own one share or one million shares, you are a part owner of this business. The legendary investor Warren Buffett has said that investors often focus on a daily share price movement rather than on making an objective assessment of the long-term prospects of a company and deciding what the business might be worth in the coming years.

I will do whatever it takes to ensure that the business delivers on both its ideal market positioning within corporate reporting and structured AI data and its significant commercial potential. Victory will not be achieved overnight: it requires thought, planning, strong execution and some patience. I regard our success as a matter of not if but when.
