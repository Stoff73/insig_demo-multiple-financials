## 2.1. Basis of preparation of Financial Statements

The Group and Company Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. The Group and Company Financial Statements have also been prepared under the historical cost convention.

The Financial Statements are presented in Pound Sterling rounded to the nearest pound.

The preparation of Financial Statements in conformity with UK adopted International Accounting Standards (IAS) requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Accounting Policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the Group and Company Financial Statements are disclosed in Note 4.

## 2.3. Basis of Consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries made up to 31 March 2024. Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has control. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
