Many mispricings occur **because conventional metrics fail to reflect true value**.

# 1: Valuation Profile ‚Äî Full Diagnostic Toolkit

## **Primary Ratios (Standard Entry Point)**

| Metric        | What It Captures                                  | When It Fails                                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **EV/EBITDA** | Core operating cash flow before capital intensity | Capital-light SaaS, capex-heavy infra, or distressed |
| **P/E**       | Earnings multiple                                 | Loss-makers, high amortization, exceptional items    |
| **FCF Yield** | Capital return potential                          | Large capex cycles or cyclically depressed           |
| **EV/EBIT**   | True operational profitability                    | Works better than EBITDA in industrials, utilities   |

## **Valuation Pass/Fail Criteria by Method**

| Valuation Method                 | Key Metric(s)            | PASS (Compelling)             | MONITOR (Neutral/Contextual) | FAIL (Avoid/Watchlist)               |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **EV/EBITDA**                    | LTM and NTM              | < 5.0x                        | 5.0x ‚Äì 7.5x                  | > 7.5x unless growth/cyclic case     |
| **P/E**                          | LTM, 1Y Forward          | < 10x                         | 10‚Äì15x                       | > 15x unless secular growth          |
| **FCF Yield**                    | FCF / EV                 | > 10%                         | 6‚Äì10%                        | < 6% or negative FCF                 |
| **EV/EBIT**                      | Operating Profit Base    | < 7x                          | 7‚Äì10x                        | > 10x unless margin upside evident   |

### Notes on Interpretation

* **Fail ‚â† automatic discard**, especially in early screens. If it fails *but other signals scream ‚Äúmispriced‚Äù*, I log it as **watchlist** or seek *alt valuation confirmation*.
* **Monitor = "Prove It" stage**. Usually needs catalyst, insider alignment, or reorg underway.
* **Pass = green light for deeper due diligence**, and if paired with catalysts, moves to deep dive queue.

### Additional Failure Filters (Across All Metrics)

| Factor                                   | Immediate Red Flag                       |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Declining FCF despite revenue growth     | Unsustainable model or poor cost control |
| Frequent ‚Äúadjusted EBITDA‚Äù with one-offs | Masking structural margin issues         |
| Ballooning working capital or inventory  | Channel stuffing, demand misread         |
| Share count creep without accretive ROI  | Poor capital discipline                  |
| Disclosures inconsistent across filings  | Governance or reporting quality issue    |

## Interpretation Framework

Is the valuation depressed cyclically or structurally broken?
Are we looking at compressed multiples due to fixable issues (e.g., temporary margin pressure), or is it a terminal value trap?

## Checks

Compare against 3-year historical band
Peer comp table (Bloomberg RV function)
Historical reversion analysis

# 2: Ownership & Insider Signal Layer

---

### **Why It Matters**

1. **Insider skin in the game** ‚Üí Increases likelihood of shareholder-aligned decisions.
2. **Cluster buying** ‚Üí Stronger signal than one-off token buys.
3. **Activist activity or new strategic holders** ‚Üí Indicates potential for change.
4. **Recent insider selling / dilution** ‚Üí Red flags governance or cash stress.

This is about finding **alignment, intent, and direction of travel**‚Äîwell before the financials even change.

### **Daniel Osei‚Äôs Forensic Playbook**

1. **Audit Segment-Level P\&L Trends**

   * Look for sudden profitability shifts, new ‚ÄúOther‚Äù line items
   * Segment reporting opacity = often a smokescreen

2. **Reconcile Management Adjusted Figures**

   * Map bridge from IFRS/GAAP to adjusted EBITDA
   * Flag any ‚Äúone-off‚Äù items appearing in 3+ consecutive periods

3. **Review Working Capital Build-Up**

   * Inventory spikes without sales = demand overstatement
   * DSO (Days Sales Outstanding) trending up = aggressive revenue

4. **Examine Capitalization Practices**

   * Is R\&D or software development being capitalized too aggressively?
   * Are lease liabilities or pension obligations buried off-B/S?

5. **Assess Auditor Quality & Tenure**

   * Big 4 with long tenure: ‚ö†Ô∏è entrenchment risk
   * Mid-tier + sudden changes: üö© concealment risk

---

### **Source Documents Used**

* Full Annual Report (especially Notes to Financials)
* MD\&A (Management Discussion & Analysis)
* Segmental Data
* Remuneration Report (to understand earnings-linked incentives)
* Auditor Report (incl. key risk areas)
* Governance Disclosures (for red flag crosschecks)

### **Daniel Osei‚Äôs Forensic Tasks**

1. **Debt Breakdown**

   * By tranche, interest rate, maturity, covenants
   * Identify bullets vs. amortizing structure
   * Check if debt tied to specific assets (ring-fenced or enterprise-wide)

2. **Covenant Exposure**

   * Examine RCF or term loan agreements for EBITDA/net debt, fixed charge coverage, or liquidity tests
   * Flag any risk of breach given projected figures

3. **Pension & Lease Review**

   * Assess actuarial assumptions: discount rate, growth, mortality
   * IFRS 16 lease treatment: Right-of-use assets vs liabilities

4. **Contingent Liabilities**

   * Look for legal provisions, guarantees, environmental costs, tax disputes
   * Often buried in footnotes or interim disclosures

5. **Asset Quality Check**

   * Goodwill to total assets: >30% = impairment risk
   * PP\&E composition: Is it truly productive or outdated?
