**Summary and Conclusion:**

XP Power has faced a challenging first half of 2025 with revenue decline and sharply reduced profitability evidenced by operating and net margin compression into negative territory. Valuation multiples paint a mixed picture: while price-to-sales and EV to revenue remain reasonable, multiples involving earnings (EV/EBITDA, P/E) are elevated or not available due to lack of profits, signaling market caution.

The liquidity and leverage metrics show prudent management of debt levels and reasonable short-term liquidity ratios, but cash availability (cash ratio) and interest coverage are weak, highlighting susceptibility in cash management and debt servicing if headwinds persist.

Operational efficiency and asset utilization metrics warrant monitoring but have not materially deteriorated. Earnings quality shows concerning discrepancies between adjusted and statutory results and poor EBITDA to free cash flow conversion, cautioning on quality of reported profitability.

In context, XP Power’s interim results reflect a business under pressure from market headwinds, with some operational resilience in gross margin and working capital management but profit conversion issues and cash flow constraints. The stock trades with mixed valuation signals, reflecting both underlying asset value and current operational challenges.

For a forward-looking valuation or investment decision, additional detailed forecasts, scenario analyses, and deeper cash flow scrutiny are recommended. Key documents needed would be detailed management guidance or forecast models to assess recovery potential.
