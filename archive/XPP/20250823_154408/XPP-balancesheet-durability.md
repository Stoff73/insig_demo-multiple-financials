Summary of Analysis:

XP Power Limited, trading as XPP, is undergoing a recovery phase after a difficult first half of 2025 afflicted by revenue contraction (-13%), currency headwinds and higher operational costs. While order intake and book-to-bill ratios improved markedly (+28% intake), this operational improvement has yet to translate into profitability, with statutory net losses reported and significant divergence between adjusted and statutory earnings. The presence of substantial one-off foreign exchange losses (£2.3m) and large accounting adjustments raise questions about earnings repeatability.

The valuation multiples reflect investor caution with relatively low prices against book value, and elevated EV multiples on earnings. Liquidity remains acceptable overall but contends with low cash buffers and marginal interest coverage, warranting close monitoring. Operational efficiency presents mixed results: receivables management is solid while asset and inventory turnover require enhancement to support profitability improvement.

Earnings quality concerns arise from the wide gap between adjusted and statutory results and poor EBITDA to free cash flow conversion, signaling pressure on cash generation despite accounting profits.

The company’s asset quality is stable with manageable goodwill balances and prudent investment spending. Cash flow positivity albeit modest offers some financial underpinning during turnaround.

Conclusion:

XP Power is navigating a complex operating environment with encouraging signs in order momentum yet overshadowed by weak earnings, earnings quality questions, and liquidity constraints. Investors should focus on management’s ability to sustain adjusted earnings improvements, narrow the gap to statutory profits, generate stronger cash flows, and improve operational efficiency to restore confidence in repeatable economic earnings.

Additional information needed includes detailed explanations of adjustments between statutory and reported profits, quarterly cash flow and financing schedules to assess liquidity risk, and forward guidance on strategic initiatives for margin and cash flow recovery.
