**Summary and Conclusion:**

XP Power (ticker: XPP) is currently facing challenging market conditions as reflected in its H1 2025 financials. While order intake shows strong growth (+28%), revenue declined by 13% year-over-year, and profitability metrics have deteriorated significantly with operating profit down 64% and a net loss period reflected by negative net margin and loss per share.

Valuation ratios show mixed signals: the market values shares below book value (low P/B) and holds cautious expectations as EV multiples are high relative to earnings but moderate relative to revenues and sales. The price to free cash flow ratio indicates market hopes for recovery and growth despite current cash flow challenges.

Profitability margins are thin, with gross margin stable but operating and net margins sharply down. Returns on assets and equity are negative, highlighting operational and financial pressures.

Liquidity is adequate with strong current and quick ratios, but the cash buffer is thin and interest coverage is weak, suggesting potential risks if profitability does not improve. Leverage remains moderate and manageable.

Operational efficiency is mixed: receivables management is solid but asset and inventory turnover suggest efficiency and inventory management could improve.

Earnings quality is a concern given large differences between statutory and adjusted figures, and poor EBITDA to free cash flow conversion points to cash generation challenges.

Asset quality appears reasonable with controlled goodwill and balanced capex spending, while cash flow is positive but low relative to liabilities.

**Recommendation:** The company is in a turnaround phase with clear operational challenges suppressing earnings and cash flow. Monitoring recovery in margins, cash conversion, and earnings quality will be key. Valuation multiples could imply downside risk, but improving order intake and positive free cash flow are encouraging signs.

**Additional Information Required:**  
- Quarterly cash flow and debt repayment schedules for more refined liquidity assessment.  
- Details on adjustments causing large gaps in reported vs adjusted profits.  
- Forward guidance or management commentary on margin improvement strategies.
