**Summary and Conclusions:**

XP Power is currently under operational and financial stress reflecting market channel destocking, currency headwinds, and structural economic uncertainty. While order intake growth (+28%) and improving book-to-bill ratios are encouraging signs of market recovery, revenue declined 13% year-over-year. Gross margin remains robust due to cost control and manufacturing efficiency improvements.

However, profitability metrics deteriorated sharply with a 64% fall in adjusted operating profit partly due to £2.3m of one-off adverse foreign exchange accounting charges, large gaps between adjusted and statutory earnings (Adjusted Operating Profit £4.8m vs Statutory £2.6m), and net losses reported on statutory basis. This disparity highlights the need for cautious interpretation of pro forma numbers and indicates earnings quality issues.

Liquidity is sufficient but with low cash buffers and strained interest coverage (1.5x), leverage is moderate and manageable. Operationally, asset utilisation and inventory turnover require monitoring as efficiency improvements are vital.

Earnings quality shows some risk given the wide gap between adjusted and statutory profits and poor EBITDA to free cash flow conversion (13.6%), signal cash generation issues despite accounting profits.

Overall, XP Power is in a turnaround and recovery phase with signs of stabilizing order intake and efficiency gains. However, earnings remain fragile and heavily impacted by one-offs and currency effects. Investors should monitor improvements in adjusted profit sustainability, cash flow conversion, and reduction of accounting adjustments to gain confidence in repeatable economic earnings.

**Additional information needed to refine assessment:**

- The detailed reconciliation and composition of adjustments from statutory to adjusted results in note 5 (absent here) to isolate recurring vs non-recurring items.  
- Quarterly cash flow and debt maturity schedules to evaluate liquidity risk in detail.  
- Forward guidance or more granular management commentary on margin improvement strategy to assess return to normalised profitability.
