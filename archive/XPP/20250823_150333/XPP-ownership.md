## Summary Analysis

XP Power Limited is navigating a challenging market environment in H1 2025, with revenue declining by 11% on a constant currency basis due to channel destocking and structural market pressures. Despite this, order intake improved strongly by 31% in constant currency terms resulting in a book-to-bill ratio exceeding 1.0x, a positive leading indicator of demand recovery.

Improved gross margin to 41.4% evidences manufacturing efficiencies and successful cost management, while operating profit and net margin remain under pressure, reflected by operating margin at 4.3% and statutory net loss. Liquidity is sufficient to meet short-term obligations, but cash reserves are tight, emphasizing the need for continual cash flow focus.

Valuation multiples present a mixed picture: sales-related multiples and EV/Revenue are reasonable, while multiples reliant on earnings are adversely skewed by recent losses, resulting in high EV/EBITDA and EV/EBIT ratios and no meaningful P/E ratio. The market appears to price in operational recovery potential balanced against short-term profitability and cash flow constraints.

Leverage details beyond net debt and net debt to EBITDA coverage (1.8x) are unavailable; this limits a full capital structure risk assessment.

## Conclusion

XP Power currently faces profitability and cash liquidity challenges, reflected in multiple performance metrics. However, firm order intake growth, gross margin improvements, and active cost reduction initiatives show encouraging operational momentum. The elevated valuation multiples based on earnings must be interpreted with caution but highlight investor expectations for recovery. The company is positioned as a potential turnaround candidate, contingent on market stabilization and continued operational improvements.

Additional ownership composition and detailed leverage metrics would enhance financial risk assessment.

If additional detailed financial statements or leverage data become available, I am ready to integrate and update this analysis.
