Summary Analysis:

XP Power Limited, as per H1 2025 results, is experiencing a challenging operational environment with declining revenues (down 11% constant currency) despite a strong 31% increase in order intake, signalling an improving demand outlook. The valuation multiples reflect market skepticismâ€”high EV/EBITDA and EV/EBIT ratios contrast with modest price-to-sales and price-to-book indicators, with the P/E ratio absent due to negative statutory earnings.

Profitability remains constrained with operating margin at 4.3%, net loss margins, and negative returns on assets and equity, evidencing underlying earnings pressure. However, gross margin improvement to 41.4% suggests some operational efficiencies or pricing strategies are effective.

Liquidity metrics indicate reasonable short-term coverage but tight cash resources. The absence of debt/leverage data limits a full capital structure risk evaluation.

Conclusion:

XP Power is currently underperforming on profitability with profitability and return metrics below expectations. However, some valuation metrics like P/S and EV/Revenue remain reasonable. The improving order intake and book-to-bill ratios suggest potential recovery ahead, but immediate caution is warranted given the negative earnings and tight cash ratios. Additional data on leverage ratios is needed to assess financial risk fully. Overall, XP Power may represent a turnaround opportunity if operating efficiencies and market recovery materialize but currently trades at elevated multiples relative to earnings.
