## 3. Forensic Quality and Sustainability Analysis

XP Power Limited’s H1 2025 results illustrate a company navigating a difficult market environment marked by lingering channel destocking, FX currency headwinds, and geopolitical trade impacts, especially related to China and US tariffs.

The valuation ratios reveal a disconnect typical of cyclical recoveries and earnings stress. The P/E multiple is uninformative due to statutory losses, while overly high EV/EBITDA and EV/EBIT multiples reflect weak profitability and elevated enterprise valuation. The moderate P/S and EV/Revenue multiples indicate that the market still values the company’s sales base fairly.

Profitability metrics confirm economic earnings pressures. Despite a commendable improvement in gross margin to 41.4% due to manufacturing efficiencies and tariff cost pass-through, operating and net margins remain weak or negative. Negative returns on assets and equity illustrate inefficient use of capital and asset bases for profitable growth. Low ROCE highlights capital employment concerns.

Liquidity analysis offers mixed signs: current and quick ratios are healthy, reflecting adequate short-term liquidity, yet the low cash ratio signals constrained cash reserves, which can be risky if operational challenges persist.

Leverage data, while limited, shows net debt funds at manageable multiples of adjusted EBITDA (1.8x), and a modest debt to equity, but interest coverage is concerningly low at ~1.5x, hinting at potential stress servicing debt costs if profitability does not improve.

Efficiency measures reveal average asset utilization and inventory turnover consistent with cyclically pressured markets. Receivables are well-managed as indicated by turnover rates and days sales outstanding within acceptable ranges.

Earnings quality red flags emerge with a poor EBITDA to free cash flow conversion ratio (13.6%) and a very large gap (84.6%) between adjusted and statutory results, implying significant non-cash or one-off adjustments that challenge the sustainability and quality of reported earnings. The accruals ratio is reasonable, suggesting no aggressive earnings manipulation, but the high adjusted/statutory gap warrants ongoing scrutiny.

Asset quality indicators suggest reasonable goodwill exposure (17.7%) and capex slightly above depreciation, requiring monitoring for capitalization policies potentially inflating asset bases.

Cash flow is under pressure in the short term with a low operating cash flow ratio but good cash conversion over time. Free cash flow remains positive but modest.

Operationally, the strong order intake (+31% constant currency) and book-to-bill above 1.0x indicate demand recovery potential. Cost efficiencies and product innovation support margin improvements and position XP Power for growth once market conditions stabilize. The company’s strategy emphasizes supply chain flexibility, manufacturing footprint optimization, and product pipeline strength.

However, the current earnings and cash flow profile reflect transitional pressures with risk on earnings quality sustainability given the large adjusted/statutory discrepancy and one-offs (notably FX). Tight cash resources and modest interest coverage add to financial risk in the near term.

## 4. Conclusion

XP Power Limited’s H1 2025 financials present a company under clear operational strain but exhibiting early signs of recovery. Reported economic earnings are depressed due to market destocking, FX adjustments, and transitional challenges. Profitability ratios and return metrics confirm weak economic returns and earnings quality concerns. Liquidity is currently sufficient but cash resources are tight. Leverage appears moderate, but interest coverage risk exists.

Strengths include solid order inflows, margin improvement, operational efficiencies, and a robust product pipeline, suggesting potential for sustainable recovery.

Investors and stakeholders should treat reported earnings cautiously given significant adjusted versus statutory gaps and poor EBITDA to FCF conversion ratios, indicating quality adjustments affecting earnings sustainability.
