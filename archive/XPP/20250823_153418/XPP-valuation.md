- **EV/EBITDA:** The multiple suggests investors expect stable or growing EBITDA margins. XP Power’s consistent operational profitability and margins underpinned this valuation metric, evidencing confidence in cash flows.

- **Dividend Yield:** The modest dividend yield balances shareholder returns with reinvestment needs—a strategy consistent with the company’s growth trajectory and capital expenditure plans.

- **Return on Equity:** A double-digit ROE denotes efficient capital usage and consistent profitability, supporting a premium valuation.

- **Debt to Equity:** Conservative leverage reduces financial risk, giving XP Power resilience against economic downturns, aligning with low gearing strategies mentioned in the company overview.
