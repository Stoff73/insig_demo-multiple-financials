## 2. Detailed Narrative Analysis

XP Power's financial results reflect a company undergoing a difficult recovery phase. The interim results for the first half of 2025 show a mixed picture: order intake growth of 28% and book-to-bill above 1.0x are encouraging signs of demand recovery. However, revenue declined 13% year-on-year due to channel destocking effects, impacting cash flow and earnings.

Valuation multiples reflect market skepticism on earnings sustainability. The absence of positive earnings excludes P/E ratio usage, while EV/EBITDA and EV/EBIT ratios remain elevated, signaling depressed profitability. Price-to-sales and EV/revenue ratios are rational, indicating market valuation is anchored in top-line performance rather than profitability. The high price-to-free-cash-flow ratio alongside a low free cash flow yield mirrors the company's recent cash flow challenges.

Profitability metrics underline operational pressures: gross margin at a robust 41.4% evidences effective cost control at the manufacturing level, but operating margin is weak at 4.3%, indicating escalated SG&A and other costs squeezing profits. Negative net margin, negative returns on assets and equity demonstrate the firm is unable to generate positive returns for shareholders currently.

Liquidity appears generally adequate to manage near-term working capital needs, evidenced by current and quick ratios above 1.0x, but a low cash ratio heightens risk if cash generation falters further. Leverage ratios show moderate net debt relative to EBITDA, improved from prior periods, but interest coverage near 1.5x poses risk and suggests tighter financial flexibility.

Efficiency and earnings quality metrics reveal mixed signals: asset turnover and inventory turnover are middling, pointing to some operational inefficiencies or demand softness. Receivables turnover and DSO are healthy, supporting cash inflows. While accrual levels are conservative, suggesting earnings are anchored by cash flows, a large discrepancy between adjusted and statutory earnings flags possible recurring "one-off" or non-cash adjustments that mask the underlying economic performance.

On asset quality, goodwill levels remain moderate without signs of impairment risk, although capex outpacing depreciation requires monitoring to ensure capital investments translate into profitability.

Cash flow metrics reveal a pronounced gap between EBITDA and actual operating/free cash flow, a red flag for cash conversion quality and potential earnings inflation. Positive free cash flow is a bright spot but modest in scale, limiting reinvestment capacity.

## 3. Conclusion

XP Power presents as a company in a cautious recovery stage facing structural earnings challenges. While underlying revenue demand is improving, operating profitability and cash flow generation remain weak and vulnerable to pressure. The pronounced divergence between adjusted and statutory earnings, coupled with low free cash flow conversion, calls for vigilance about the repeatability and quality of reported profits. Liquidity and leverage are manageable but with tight interest coverage, leaving limited buffer against adverse conditions.

Investment justification rests on the company's ability to translate improving order intake into sustained profitable growth and enhanced cash generation. Without clear progress on operating cost control, cash flow conversion, and transparency on "one-off" adjustments, earnings quality remains compromised, raising risk for investors relying solely on reported profits.

Further analysis would benefit from more granular segment profitability data, detailed cash flow breakdowns, and audited disclosures on adjustments and shareholder ownership concentrations to evaluate incentive alignment and potential bias.

## 4. Additional Information & Data Recommendations

- Detailed breakdown of "one-off" charges and adjusted vs statutory reconciliations to understand recurring vs non-recurring items.
- Segment profitability and margin trends to isolate areas with earnings strength or weakness.
- Ownership details especially related to major shareholders for assessment of governance risks.
- Forward-looking management guidance on expected cash flow and profitability normalization.
- Complete leverage and debt covenants disclosure to assess refinancing and liquidity risk.
