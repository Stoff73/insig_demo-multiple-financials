## 2. Detailed Narrative Analysis

XP Power's interim results for H1 2025 show cautious signs of recovery following challenging market conditions. Order intake grew strongly by 28% year on year to £112.7 million, driven particularly by the industrial technology sector and nearing completion of channel destocking. Despite this, reported revenue declined 13%, reflecting residual destocking effects and challenging demand.

Profitability remains under pressure with a negative statutory loss before tax of £1.4 million and adjusted operating profit shrinking 64% to £4.8 million. Gross margin remained robust at 41.4%, printing a modest improvement from prior periods, indicative of effective manufacturing cost control and tariff cost pass-through. However, operating and net margins are weak or negative (4.3% and -1.3% respectively), highlighting escalated operational expenses and margin compression. Returns on assets, equity, and capital employed are all negative or well below thresholds, underscoring inefficient asset use and erosion of shareholder value.

Liquidity ratios show reasonable strength with current and quick ratios of 1.8x and 1.1x respectively, signaling the company can comfortably meet short term obligations. However, the cash ratio is low at 0.2x, signaling low cash buffers in relation to liabilities, potentially risking liquidity if cash flows deteriorate. The company reduced net debt significantly, from £104.2m to £57.9m, reflecting good cash flow conversion and a capital raise earlier in the year, improving leverage metrics (Net Debt / Adj. EBITDA at 1.8x).

Valuation multiples by the market echo the earnings and cash flow challenges: no positive earnings prevent use of P/E ratio; EV/EBITDA and EV/EBIT multiples are elevated, reflecting depressed earnings. Price-to-sales and EV/revenue ratios remain reasonable, indicating value is placed on revenue sustainability. Price-to-free-cash-flow at 59.5x and low free cash flow yield of 1.7% flag weak cash generation relative to market valuation and inherent liquidity risks.

From an earnings quality perspective, the notable divergence between adjusted and statutory profits (operating profit £4.8m vs statutory £2.6m; loss before tax adjusted £0.8m vs statutory loss £1.4m) suggests presence of significant one-off or non-cash accounting adjustments. The report highlights one-off accounting charges from foreign exchange of £2.3m impacting adjusted operating profit. This raises questions about the repeatability and economic reality of reported adjusted profitability. 

Operational management actions including £5.5m annualised cost reductions and inventory reductions underline attempts to restore efficiency and profitability. However, the continuing weak cash conversion relative to EBITDA and raised adjusted versus statutory profit gap require monitoring for potential earnings manipulation or recurring "one-off" classification that may mask the true earnings quality.

## 3. Conclusion

XP Power is navigating a recovery phase amidst considerable operating and liquidity challenges. Encouraging order intake growth and gross margin resilience offer hopeful signs. Nonetheless, weak operating profitability and negative net margins, coupled with low free cash flow yield and large reconciliation gaps between adjusted and reported results, raise concern on earnings quality sustainability.

Liquidity remains adequate but with low cash reserves and tight interest cover risks persist. The reduced net debt level improves financial risk profile but vigilance is necessary for cash flow conversion and margin improvement to strengthen the balance sheet further.

For investors and stakeholders, key risks include the repeatability of earnings given the wide adjusted versus statutory profit variances, cash flow generation adequacy, and operational cost control sustainability.

Future assessments would benefit greatly from more detailed disclosures on adjustment classifications, segment-level profitability trends, full leverage covenant details, and ownership concentration data to evaluate governance incentives and potential misreporting risks.
