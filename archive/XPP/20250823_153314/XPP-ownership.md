## Analysis and Conclusion

XP Power is currently in a recovery phase after a challenging first half of 2025 marked by revenue declines and operating profit contractions versus prior year. The company's order intake increased substantially (28%), indicating improving demand and potential for future revenue stabilization.

Valuation metrics paint a cautious market view: P/E not applicable due to negative earnings, and multiple earnings-based ratios (EV/EBITDA, EV/EBIT) are elevated, signaling depressed profitability. However, revenue-based multiples (P/S, EV/Revenue) and cash flow valuation metrics indicate a fair market value relative to sales generation.

Profitability shows contrast between strong gross margins (~41%) signaling effective production cost control, versus weak operating and net margins indicating increased operating costs and margin pressure. Returns on assets, equity, and capital employed are negative or below required thresholds, highlighting the need for operational improvements to enhance efficiency and profitability.

Liquidity ratios generally imply adequacy to meet short-term liabilities comfortably, although cash reserves remain low, and cash ratio signals a liquidity risk should cash flow deteriorate further.

Leverage is moderate with Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA at 1.8x and reduced absolute debt levels following a share placing and strong cash flow conversion. This positions the company with some financial flexibility.

**Overall, XP Power’s financial profile suggests a company on a cautious recovery trajectory, with encouraging order growth but constrained profitability and liquidity challenges. Market valuation reflects this tension, valuing the business conservatively. Success in translating increased orders into sustained profit and cash flow improvements will be critical to unlock shareholder value and reduce financial risk. Future analysis would benefit from detailed ownership data, segmental margins, and forward guidance for a more comprehensive assessment.**
