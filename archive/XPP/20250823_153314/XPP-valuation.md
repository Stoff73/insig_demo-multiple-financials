### Summary Analysis:

XP Power's valuation metrics indicate the market values the group conservatively with a P/S ratio and EV/Revenue within acceptable levels but fails on price/book, EV/EBITDA, and EV/EBIT ratios, reflecting stress in earnings and profitability. The company is currently not generating positive earnings as reflected by an unavailable P/E ratio and negative net margin, confirmed by statutory losses.

Profitability ratios reveal the core strength of XP Power in maintaining gross margins above 40%, a good sign considering the challenging semiconductor and industrial environment. However, operating and net margins, as well as returns on assets and equity, are weak to negative, pointing to operational cost pressures and reduced profitability.

Liquidity ratios are comparatively stable with good current and quick ratios, implying the company can meet short term liabilities, but the low cash ratio poses some risk if cash flow deteriorates further.

Overall, XP Power is in a recovery phase after a difficult first half in 2025, with improving order intake (up 28%) but declining revenue and cash flow. Their valuation reflects market caution due to profitability risks and negative earnings. The company must focus on translating order growth into sustained profit improvements and enhancing cash generation to support valuation uplift.

### Missing Information or Additional Data Required:

- Leverage ratios details were partially missing; full leverage and debt ratios would better clarify financial risk.
- Forward guidance or segment-level margins would enhance complexity of analysis.
- Deeper cash flow breakdown and capital expenditure trends would support free cash flow valuation reliability.
