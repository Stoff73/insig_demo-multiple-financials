## Analysis Summary

- Valuation ratios are mostly missing or zero, indicating no meaningful market data or earnings.
- Profitability metrics show no returns on equity or capital employed, indicating poor performance.
- Liquidity ratios are zero, reflecting inability to meet short-term obligations.
- Leverage is zero, showing no debt, which is positive, but failed interest coverage indicates no earnings to cover interest or no interest paid.
- Efficiency ratios are zero or failing, suggesting poor operational performance or lack of business activity.
- Earnings quality ratios such as accruals and statutory adjustment gaps pass, indicative of no significant earnings manipulation, but EBITDA to FCF conversion fails, showing earnings not converted to cash.
- Asset quality shows no goodwill (a positive), but capex to depreciation and tangible book value require monitoring due to low values.
- Cash flow ratios fail, indicating poor cash conversion and no free cash flow.

## Ownership and Notes to Financials

- No ownership or insider holdings data was found in the provided markdown files.
- No notes to the financial statements or detailed disclosures are available, limiting deeper forensic insights.

## Conclusion

The available forensic accounting metrics and earnings quality ratios for STV Group PLC show a company with no meaningful current market capitalization or trading data, zero profitability and liquidity, and poor cash flow quality. The lack of ownership or detailed financial disclosures further limits assessing governance and operational quality.

The data suggests either business inactivity, reporting gaps, or that STV Group is under severe financial distress. Acquiring full financial statements, detailed segment disclosures, ownership data, and current market pricing is essential to conduct a robust forensic earnings quality assessment or valuation analysis.
