**Analysis:**

The valuation ratios for STV Group PLC are largely non-informative or indicate failure due to zero or missing market data. The P/E and Price to FCF ratios are not available (N/A), likely reflecting either a lack of earnings or no trading data. EV/EBIT shows a "PASS" but at 0.0x, which is unusual and likely not meaningful without proper revenue or EBIT numbers. EV/Revenue and FCF Yield ratios fail, reflecting no enterprise value relative to sales or low free cash flow yield, which suggests operational or reporting issues.

Profitability ratios (ROE and ROCE) are very weak or zero, with ROE at monitoring threshold and ROCE outright failing, indicating no return generated on equity and capital employed respectively. Liquidity ratios are critically low or zero, failing to meet basic operational liquidity standards, suggesting risk on short-term obligations.

Leverage depicts no debt-to-equity (value = 0), given a pass which might mean no leverage, but interest coverage ratio fails, indicating lack of earnings before interest and taxes to cover interest, potential distress or no interest costs.

Efficiency ratios across inventory turnover, receivables turnover depict failure; days sales outstanding passes but at 0 days, which may be an input or data artifact rather than a realistic metric.

Earnings quality ratios show mixed outcomes with accruals ratio and adjusted vs statutory gap passing (suggesting relatively clean earnings adjustments), but EBITDA to FCF conversion fails, indicating poor cash conversion.

Asset quality shows no goodwill and zero value ratios marked pass, but capex/depreciation and tangible book value warrant monitoring, showing potential asset base issues or investment mismatches.

Cash flow ratios fail, emphasizing challenges in converting earnings to cash and free cash flow generation.

**Context and Data Considerations:**

STV Group PLC data appears either incomplete or market data is missing as of the date referenced (August 2025). The zero or null values across market-based metrics render many financial ratios ineffective. Contrasting this with XP Power's financial disclosures from the xp-power.md file reveals a more typical operating company with significant order intake and revenues but also challenges in earnings and cash flow. XP Power's data may only serve as an indirect sectoral benchmark.

---

**Conclusions:**

- The current financial and valuation ratios for STV Group are insufficient or indicate weak financial health based on provided data.  
- The lack of share price, market cap, and enterprise value entries impedes meaningful valuation analysis.  
- The operational ratios point to poor profitability, liquidity, efficiency, and cash flow management.  
- Additional detailed financial statements, operating data or market data is required to perform a defensible valuation or investment decision.  
- If STV Group is inactive or data is missing, the current model and analysis reflect that status.
