## Analysis Summary

- The valuation and market-based ratios are largely unavailable or zero, reflecting a lack of public market data or significant earnings.
- Profitability and liquidity ratios show no returns on equity or capital and inadequate liquidity to cover short-term obligations.
- Leverage appears minimal with no debt, which is a positive, but interest coverage fails due to no EBIT.
- Efficiency indicators suggest poor operational efficiency, possibly reflecting business inactivity or reporting gaps.
- Earnings quality ratios indicate no suspicious accruals or adjustments, which may indicate either no activity or clean though minimal reported performance.
- Asset quality metrics show no goodwill risk but very low tangible net asset base and maintenance/Capex requires monitoring.
- Cash flow ratios reveal inability to convert earnings to cash and lack of free cash flow, emphasizing financial weakness or inactivity.

## Ownership and Notes to Financials

- No ownership, insider, or significant shareholder information was available in the provided markdown files.
- No notes to the financial statements or disclosures were found for STV Group PLC in the data/STV folder.
- This lack of detailed primary disclosures restricts a more robust forensic accounting or earnings quality assessment.

## Conclusion

Given the incomplete or missing financial and market data for STV Group PLC in the provided files, the company currently shows poor financial health, low or no profitability, weak liquidity, and deficient cash flow quality. The absence of ownership and financial notes obscures key qualitative factors needed for a confident forensic accounting analysis.

To refine the analysis and reconstruct true economic earnings, it is critical to obtain updated, complete financial statements, detailed segment and accounting policy disclosures, along with ownership data and market valuation inputs.
