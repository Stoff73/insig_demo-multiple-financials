Analysis:

The absence of ownership data limits understanding of STV Group PLC's shareholder structure, which is a critical component for governance, control, and risk assessment. This information gap restricts the ability to evaluate potential insider influence, institutional ownership, or blockholder effects.

Financial ratios indicate that STV Group has many zeros or unavailable values, suggesting missing or incomplete market data and financials. Key valuation multiples such as P/E and Price to FCF are not available, and others such as EV/Revenue and FCF yield fail thresholds, pointing to poor market valuation visibility or financial performance.

Profitability and liquidity ratios indicate weak or inadequate financial health with zero returns and liquidity issues. Efficiency, cash flow, and earnings quality ratios mostly fail, underscoring operational difficulties.

Leverage shows zero debt-to-equity, a positive sign, but interest coverage fails, which might be due to no earnings or interest expenses.

Asset quality and tangible book value metrics warrant monitoring, highlighting possible concerns in asset base stability or investment.

Conclusion:

- No ownership data is available in the provided files for STV Group PLC.
- Financial ratio evaluation shows a weak or incomplete financial profile, with many metrics failing or lacking data.
- This lack of data prohibits comprehensive ownership and valuation analysis.
- To advance analysis, access to current ownership disclosures, complete financial statements, and market data is vital.

Please provide any updated or additional financial and ownership information on STV Group PLC to enable more robust analysis.
