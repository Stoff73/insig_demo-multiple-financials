### Analysis Summary:

1. **Price/Earnings (P/E) Ratio (12.5)**: This ratio indicates that investors are willing to pay £12.50 for every £1 of earnings. A P/E of 12.5 suggests that STV Group PLC may be undervalued compared to industry averages, presenting a potential buying opportunity, especially if growth prospects are strong.

2. **Price/Book (P/B) Ratio (1.75)**: The P/B ratio of 1.75 suggests that the stock is trading above its book value, indicating that investors have a positive outlook for future profitability. Generally, a P/B ratio under 1 can indicate undervaluation, so this value suggests that STV is perceived as having solid growth potential.

3. **Dividend Yield (4.2%)**: A dividend yield of 4.2% is attractive, especially in the current market where investors are looking for reliable income streams. This suggests that the company is returning a meaningful portion of its profits to shareholders, which can be a sign of financial health and stability.

4. **Return on Equity (ROE) (15%)**: An ROE of 15% is strong and implies that STV Group PLC is effectively generating profits from shareholders' equity. This figure indicates efficient management and solid performance, making the company an attractive prospect for investors looking for returns on their equity investments.

5. **Current Ratio (1.3)**: A current ratio of 1.3 indicates that STV maintains sufficient liquidity to cover its short-term liabilities. A ratio above 1 is generally favorable, as it shows that the company can meet its short-term obligations, thus minimizing financial risk.

6. **Debt to Equity Ratio (0.5)**: The debt to equity ratio of 0.5 suggests a relatively low level of debt compared to equity, which indicates that STV Group PLC is not excessively leveraged. This lower leverage reduces financial risk and suggests that the company has room to take on additional debt for growth if needed.

### Conclusion:
The analysis of STV Group PLC's valuation ratios indicates a company that is poised for potential growth, with a healthy balance sheet, reasonable leverage, attractive dividends, and effective management indicated by high ROE. The current market perception, as reflected in the P/E and P/B ratios, suggests that there could be an opportunity for investors to capitalize on the company's strengths relative to its valuation. Continued monitoring of earnings growth and market conditions will be essential in making informed investment decisions moving forward.
