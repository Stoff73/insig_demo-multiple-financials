### Analysis Summary:

1. **Price/Earnings (P/E) Ratio (12.5)**: The P/E ratio of 12.5 suggests that investors are willing to pay £12.50 for every £1 of earnings, indicating potential undervaluation compared to industry benchmarks. This situation may provide a favorable buying opportunity, especially if STV can maintain or enhance its earnings in the future. 

2. **Price/Book (P/B) Ratio (1.75)**: A P/B ratio of 1.75 indicates that STV's stock is trading above its book value, which reflects a positive investor outlook regarding future profitability. This level typically implies expectations of solid operational growth and confidence in the company's management and direction. 

3. **Dividend Yield (4.2%)**: The presence of a 4.2% dividend yield signifies an attractive return for shareholders, highlighting STV's commitment to returning a substantial portion of its profits to investors. This level of yield is particularly appealing in today’s market environment, where steady income is often sought after.

4. **Return on Equity (ROE) (15%)**: An ROE of 15% stands out as a solid indicator of STV's ability to generate profits relative to its equity base. This metric reveals effective management practices and operational performance, which makes STV Group PLC attractive for equity investors focused on performance metrics.

5. **Current Ratio (1.3)**: The current ratio of 1.3 reflects that STV Group PLC has sufficient liquidity to cover its short-term liabilities, positioning it favorably against potential financial liabilities. Ratios above 1 are generally seen as a sign of good financial health, minimizing the risk of liquidity issues.

6. **Debt to Equity Ratio (0.5)**: A debt to equity ratio of 0.5 presents a picture of conservative financial leverage, indicating that STV Group PLC does not have an excessive amount of debt compared to equity. This lower leverage reduces financial risk and suggests that the company has ample capacity to finance growth through additional debt if required.

### Conclusion:
The analysis of STV Group PLC reveals a company that possesses strong fundamentals and promising growth potential. The combination of an undervalued P/E ratio, attractive dividend return, sound management reflected in the ROE, and conservative debt levels positions STV favorably for future investments. Given the financial stability represented by the current liquidity and profitability metrics, STV Group PLC appears to be a viable investment consideration. Continuous monitoring of STV's financial performance and market conditions will be essential for maintaining an informed investment stance.
